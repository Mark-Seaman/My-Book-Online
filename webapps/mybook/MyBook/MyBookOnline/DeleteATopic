* Delete a topic *                 -*-muse-*-

Occasionally you will need to delete a topic that has been
created. When a topic is deleted all of the references to that topic
are automatically removed for you.

There are two ways to delete a topic. You can select "Change Topics"
from the bottom menu and then select the topic that you wish to
delete. In the edit view you will see a delete option at the bottom of
the screen.

In order to delete multiple topics at once you can go
to the "Change Topics" screen and click on the check boxes for the
topics you want to delete. Then select the "Delete items" from the
Action list.
