There are several key technologies that are used to build MyBook. Each
of the unique technologies work together to bring a stable foundation
for the MyBook platform. Any of these technologies may be replaced by
another that provides improved characteristics. This chapter outline
the current technology stack that is used today.

**Technologies**
 * Linux
 * Apache/MySQL
 * Python/Django
 * CSS/HTML

**Django** 
The most important technology decision for MyBook is the
selection of the Django web application framework. Django is perfect
for these types of applications. It is easy to write shell scripts
that write the custom code for the application.

Django is very flexible in allowing custom code where it is needed
while eliminating any repeated code structures that are common within
web applications. In other words it is easy to write a simple program
that does nothing and then grow it into a powerful application by
incrementally adding features.

**Python**
The Django application framework is written mostly in the
Python programming language. Python is a very concise and powerful
language. Programmers familiar with Python are much more productive
than programmers using other languages. There is excellent support for
both high and low-level language features.

Python also enjoys some of the fastest execution times for scripting
languages. It is extremely portable and can run across many computer
architectures and operating systems.

**MySQL**
The MyBook application saves its data in a MySQL
database. MySQL is an open-sourced implementation of the Structured
Query Language (SQL) that drives most databases in use today. It is
available free of charge. It is free to use in any way that you see
fit.

Overall it is the leading choice of developers looking for an
alternative to the proprietary solutions provided by large
vendors. This issue of vendor lock-in can be a significant millstone
around the neck of any project.
