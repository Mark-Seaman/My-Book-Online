MyBook is an open-source project that gives you the ability to read,
write, and publish. We believe that everyone should be able to do this
free of charge. We also believe that the software that allows this
should be given away for other people to build on.

If you believe in this goal then work with us to build something of
value to help everyone. We have immediate needs for three main types
of contributors. First, we need programmers to help build the wish
list. Second, we need marketing people to help build and promote the
brand "MyBook". Third, we need people that can write to help add
instructions and supply feedback while they use the software.

If you want to help us build MyBookOnline.org then contact Mark Seaman
at http://MarkSeaman.org. Mark is the founder of this project and is
currently coordinating the efforts of others.
