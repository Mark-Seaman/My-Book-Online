* Building user stories *                 -*-muse-*-

An application is a collection of features that are interconnected to
support the desired user experience. Each group of related features
provides certain capabilities for the user. The scenarios that are
implemented are called "user stories". These stories describe the task
that can be performed by the application.

This project is intended to be immediately useful in its most
embryonic form. Many projects are only useful when they have been
fully completed. MyBook is organized and driven by having an initial
core functionality that is improved over time.

Each step of the evolution will only make it better. This also means
that the application itself is constantly under construction. New
features are not added to the application until they work correctly.

This gives you a stable and reliable platform that you can use that
will continue to get better over time.
