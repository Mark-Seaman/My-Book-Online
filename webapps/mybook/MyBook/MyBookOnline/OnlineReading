To read MyBook all you need is an internet connection and a web
browser. A perfect device for reading is a low cost netbook or a
iPad.

The content of the book is organized as a series of topics. Each topic
is nested under related topics to provide more details. When
displaying a page of topics the text from the topics one level down is
also displayed. This allows you to read while getting a slightly more
complete context without clicking to go deeper. This sneak-peek
feature is one of the innovations in usability unique to MyBook.

An index will get you to each of the topics in the book quickly. The
index page shows you all of the topics of the first three levels of
the book. This lets you scan the entire book looking for interesting
topics. It encourages you to skim rather than read the whole
book. People are busy and they are looking for value quickly. In this
internet age we are all looking for instant gratification.

Each page of the site has links to help you get back to where you came
from. Click on any of these link to go up in the topic list. This
gives you an extremely fast way to jump through the topics of
interests. It lets your readers catch the ideas that they are
interested in without having to wade through the rest.
