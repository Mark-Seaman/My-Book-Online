MyBook is set up to let you host your own web site.  You need to find
an internet service provider (or ISP) to setup an account that allows
you shell access.  Then download the software for MyBook onto your
computer.  Once the software is working properly on your local
computer you will transfer it to your ISP account.

In order to get this working properly you should be familiar with the
following technologies:

  * Linux command line
  * Python
  * MySQL
  * Django
  * Apache 

This is a good project for a computer hobbyist that enjoys a
challenging computer project and views the experience as a learning
opportunity.  This is definitely not the best hosting alternative to
use if you are not familiar with each of the prerequisite
technologies.
