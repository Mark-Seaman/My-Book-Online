* September 30, 2012 - Creation *

Rick O - God created everything we see from nothing.  The culmination of all creation was mankind.
God created us to be in constant communion and relationship, but he also gave us a choice.  We chose
to rebel against God's plan for us, and brought about emense suffering as a result.  The rest of the
bible is about the plan for redemption and restoration.

1. What does it mean that God thought his creation was good?

2. How do we as people reflect the image of God?

3. If you could walk with God in the garden, what would you ask him?

4. What are the things that distract you from your relationship with God?

5. Why did God give us the ability to choose if we would follow him?

6. Why were Adam and Eve forced to leave the garden?  How is this reflected in our lives?

7. In what ways have you seen God's redemptive plan in your life?
