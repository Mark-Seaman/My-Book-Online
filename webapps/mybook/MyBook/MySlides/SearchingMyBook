* Searching MyBook *                 -*-muse-*-

Each MyBook can be searched to find keywords. This makes it a perfect
format for reference materials. You can quickly jump to the topics
that you need and bypass the labor of thumbing through many pages of
material looking for the needle in your haystack.

Currently the browsers search capability is used to find the content
that you are interested in. The best way to search is to go to the
"Entire book" page. This creates an HTML page that shows all of the
content for the book.

Next you use the "Ctrl-F" key to let you set the phrase to search
for. You can use the "Next" button to select other matches. Once you
find the topic in the "Entire book" page you can use the links of the
topic titles to go the topic display for that page. This lets you find
other topics that are connected to this one.
