* My Book for the Publisher *                 -*-muse-*-

Publishing involves the administration of the site, authors, and
content. As a publisher you can create a new site to be used to
display your online book. Creating a new book means that you create a
place for the book on the server and create a database that holds all
of your content. It also displays the content of your book using a web
address (know as a URL) that is unique to your book.

Sometimes
you will want to delete topic completely from the database. Note that
this is different than deleting the text within a topic. MyBook
provides tools for deleting the records that hold topics that you no
longer want. Go to the "Change topics" link in the authoring tools to
remove unwanted topics.

As a publisher you can grant permission
to other authors. This allows them to collaborate with you on a MyBook
project. It is a great way to jointly develop an online book
together.

As a publisher you can download a copy of the entire
web site as a data file. This gives you an electronic form of the book
in a single file. You can backup your copy of the book and restore it
later if you wish. This gives you full control over your MyBook
content. The web site is then nothing more than a display vehicle for
your content.
