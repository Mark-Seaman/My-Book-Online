* About My Book Online *                 -*-muse-*-

MyBook is an electronic publishing format that allows you to author
and publish your content on the internet. Readers can either browse
the content interactively on the web or download the entire book for
off-line reading, when you don't have an active internet connection.

Authors can create the material online and download a copy of the data
file to their local computer for safe keeping. You own the content
file that is displayed on your My Book site.  You can move from
creating content to instant publishing.

As a publisher you can
create your own site which is hosted at My Book Online.org. You can
also download the software and use it to set up your own host
environment.
