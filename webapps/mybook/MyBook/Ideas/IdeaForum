* Idea Forum *              -*-muse-*-

In ancient Greece the citizens would gather in the marketplace to
share ideas. Each person would have opportunities to discuss the key
topics of the day. New ideas would emerge from this forum that would
change the nature of the society that then lived in.

Today's technology allow for a resurrected version of the idea
forum. Using online tools people can gather with others that share a
common interest. Ideas can be exchange and developed.

One idea stimulates another. Just hearing what someone else thinks
about a subject invokes a response. A new idea is built on the old one
and true value is created. Without the interaction ideas do not evolve
nearly as fast.

Participating in an idea forum can be facinating; the interaction is
exhillarating. The forum provides a robust context for discussion and
also the means to keep it going.
