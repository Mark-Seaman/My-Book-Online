* Next Step *                 -*-muse-*-

The best way to change something that you really care about is to
learn about it a quickly as possible. If you take a series of small
steps you will learn what really works and what doesn't. 

When you are facing a problem that is unknowable, then action is the
quickest way to understanding.  Design each step as an experiment that
will help you better grasp the key factors in the unknown situation.

The next step on any specific project should be to maximize your
learning.  If you already understand the project fully then this is
not needed because the impact of your actions is absolutely
predictable.  Most projects have a large number of unknown things that
must be approached in this way.

These questions will help you to define your next step:
    1. What am I most passionate about?
    2. What do I already know?
    3. What resources can I invest?
    4. Who can help me?

Spend about 10% of your time developing the answers to these
questions.  This will give you a great deal of direction in your
project.  When you feel like you have a solid understanding of your
objective then answer the following questions.

    5. What can I do to learn the most?
    6. How much am I willing to lose?
    7. What is the expected outcome?

Do each step to move closer to your goal and to gain understanding.  A
well designed step will often pay for itself.  Then follow up on
everything that is learned in the process.   If the benefit exceeds
the cost then you can continue this process forever.

If you truly learn from each step that you take then the benefit will
far exceed the cost of each step.  When you achieve a big win, then
study why that was so successful.  Continue to pursue this new line of
logic to duplicate the success.

Adapt constantly.  Do more of what works, and less of what doesn't.
Create an agenda of other experiments and prioritize them based on the
benefit that they would give you.
