* What makes a great idea? *                 -*-muse-*-

There are a lot of ideas floating around.   How can you tell the
difference between a great idea and an horrible one?  All great ideas have
certain common elements.  It is easy to recognize a great idea when
you know what to look for.

An idea never exists by itself. It always connects with other ideas.
It builds upon them and extends them in some meaningful way.  This
means that an idea requires the right time and place in order to make
it successful.  An idea that is "ahead of it's time" will not succeed
because there may be certain prerequists missing.

A great idea solves a real problem.  As an inventer I tend to look at
the world through the lens of real problems and potential solutions.
Solving a problem produces value.  Ideas are a better way to address
some problem that people are having.

It takes energy to solve problems, but it also produces a
benefit. Attempt to understand the expected return on the investment
of any solution before implementing it.

Some ideas require a lot of effort to fully implement them.  For these,
it is best to create some kind of an experiment to verify the expected
ROI.  Try to reduce the cost of any idea that you are about to
implement to what you are willing to lose.

Tackle a big idea as a series of smaller ideas.  This way you limit
the risk of your big idea not working out, while producing real value
sooner. As you implement the smaller ideas you may find that your over
goal changes from what you learn.

Many ideas sound great when discussing them, but fail when you try to
implementat them.  This is why it is good to try to implement the idea
as soon as possible.  Learn what works an doesn't work, before you
commit too many resources.

Use what you learn to modify your approach and refine the idea
itself.  Prevent failure by learning and adapting.
