* Choosing To Act *                 -*-muse-*-

How do you select the next thing to act on?  There are a lot of
possible things that you could do next.  Which one gets your
attention?

Consider building a list of things that you would like to work
on. Each item on this list is a possible candidate for your next
project.  The first step in selecting what to act on is choosing which
project warrants your attention.

If you can postpone any project without feeling anything then do it.
An urgent project will create a feeling of anguish when you attempt to
postpone it.  Ask yourself if you can allow this project to wait for a
month before working on it. The project that should get your attention
is the one that demands you to act soon.

The desire to act can be motivated by a positive feeling (by realizing
the great benefit that you could get), or by a negative emotion (this
will be painful if you don't address it).  Your emotional response is
a good indicator of the importance of each project.

Try to split your time between the projects that are driven by
positive and negative emotions.  The first are important while the
second are urgent.  Don't allow all of your time to be eaten up by
urgent issues. 

Make time for your positive goals.  Do just enough urgent stuff to
keep you out of trouble while you focus on the goals that build a
better life.  At the end of your life you will not recall the urgent
stuff that you were able to complete, but the goals that helped you
achieve your dreams.
