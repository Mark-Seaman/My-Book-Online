* Building a perfect brain *                 -*- muse -*-

For years now I have been searching for the perfect brain.  Now
finally I think I found it.  

This sounds a little wierd but many people are searching for the same
thing. Life is full of experiences, ideas, contacts, problems to
solve, solutions found, and useless information.  Imagine a system
that could record all of this for you.

Sure, you could use your inner brain to remember these things.  But
wouldn't it be better to have an outer brain that could take on this
role? Your exterior brain can be used to organize all of the information
that you should not be trying to remember.

I will show you how to build an effective exterior brain.  Organize your
information to relieve your stress.  There is a lot of anxiety tied to
trying to remember things.  Get everything in writing and breathe
easier.

In this series of articles you will see how to go about building your
own brain to hold important items.  In order to be effective a brain
must have a few essential ingredients.  If you miss any of these you
will not use it enough to get any benefit from it.  A poorly
constructed brain is worse than no brain at all.

It is also vital to learn how to use your brain.  What should you
store there? How do you keep the information there fresh and well
organized? We will look at the process for managing the content of
your brain so that it is ready when you need it.

Anyone can build an exterior brain.  There are a few general principles
to follow and a healthy dose of common sense.  But with about 10
hours of effort you can have all of the core pieces producing benefits
for you every day.
