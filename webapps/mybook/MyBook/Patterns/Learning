* Learning *                 -*-muse-*-

Learning is the way that you better yourself.  Everyone can benefit from learning new skills.  We
are all in a perpetual state of personal growth throughout our lives.  

Don't ever stop learning.  Here are some patterns that will help you to continue developing as a person.

**Yearly conference** 

Select a conference within your profession.  Use this as an opportunity to
take the pulse of your industry.  Interact with others as much as possible.  Build a list of new
opportunities for further exploration.

**Skim a book** 

Go to the library or book store.  Select a book that catches your eye.  Spend on
hour to get the most that you can from the book.  Write a single paragraph about what you learned
from this book.  Concentrate on the one big idea of the book.  Think about the structure of
subjects in the chapters.  Decide if you would like to read the book in detail sometime later.

**Study a book** 

Find the best book on the subject that you want to learn.  Create a set of notes
that highlights what you find useful in the book. Outline the structure of the table of contents.
Write one paragraph for each chapter in the book. Select four parts that you want to remember five
years from now. Describe these in detail. Learn about sources for finding out more in each of these
areas. 

**Capture ideas** 

Practice capturing ideas quickly.  The typical idea will evaporate in five
seconds.  Can you capture it first? Try always carrying a pen and pad. Have an idea list on your
computer.  Set aside time to process your idea list.  Use old ideas to spark new ones.

**Learn and share best practices** 

Decide that you want to develop best practices.  Make a list
of practices that you use, and a list of ones that you are still working on.  Set aside time to
refine these 'how to' ideas.  Share them with others and ask for input.  Reject practices that no
longer work for you.

**Learning budget** 

Buy lots of books or become a regular at the library.  They are cheap, but your
time is not. Move to ebooks so that you can always have them with you.  Read only if you get
something out of it.  Don't read a lame book; life is too short. Nibble on something tasty.  When
you are done with a book give it away.

**Learning ROI** 

Invest is learning things that will give you the most value.  Constantly be
thinking about the return on investment of what you learn. What skills do you most wish that you
had?  Pursue these first.  Go broad to lower your risk.  Go deep to get extreme value.

**Dreyfus scale** 

All learning goes through five unique stages: Novice, Beginner, Competent,
Proficient, Expert.  Learn what these levels mean and how to tell what level you are at for each
skill that you use.  Make an inventory of skills you have and ones you need.  Focus your learning
to close the skill gap.

**Learning curve** 

Any trick that you know can be performed in an hour.  You can learn any trick in
a day.  A project is usually a series of tricks.  Count how many tricks are needed and how many you
already know.  Estimate 8 hours for every new trick, and an hour for known ones.  A trick that you
have done once or twice is worth 4 hours.  Sum the total time.  Double the total to account for
surprises. The result is very close to what you will actually spend.

**Remember what you've learned** 

Write down everything that you learn in an electronic notebook.
Use a wiki to organize your ideas.  Allow the structure to evolve over time.  Constantly fiddle
with the content making a series of small changes.  Have some areas that are highly organised and
others that are highly chaotic.  Let the content express its own organization.  Review and remove
old topics.  Use new topics to spur others.  Make your own wikipedia.

**Learn every week** 

Set aside several hours each week just for learning.  This will quickly become
your favorite time.  Fill the regular time with regular activities.  Balance usefulness with
enjoyment. Have a list of subjects that you would like to research or skills to develop.  Meet with
friends to discover what they are learning.
 
**Investment model for learning** 

Maximize the benefit from the effort you put in.  Some books are
worth a skim, others warrant full-body emersion.  Some events or classes are worth a great deal of
time while others are not worthwhile at all.  Become discerning enough to distinguish between
them.  Try to measure value in hours.
