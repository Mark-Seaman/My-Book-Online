* Best Practices for Better Living *                 -*-muse-*-

I have always been interested in best practices.  It is like a game to figure out the best way to do
something.  It requires experimentation, evaluation, and refinement to get to the right answer.

This web site is dedicated to sharing the best practices that I use in my everyday life.  As an
engineer, I am interested in a wide variety of topics.  

But my approach to these topics is extremely analytical. It feels great to pick apart things and
reassemble them.  It helps to really understand them.

This work is based on finding the patterns in life.  These patterns occur everywhere.  When a given
pattern is encountered there is a rule that can be applied to produce the best possible outcome.

I hope you enjoy this web site and find it interesting.  If you find the material then drop me a line.
What patterns have you discovered that you would like to share with others?
