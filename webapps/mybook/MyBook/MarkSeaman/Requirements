Many software projects start without clear goals about. Business
changes and a growing understanding of the problem must be
incorporated into the project plans. 

Mark uses an approach that works closely with clients to clearly
understand the problem by showing them specific solutions to
individual problems. 

This guides the development process and creates constant feedback. It
also guarantees that the most important features are implemented
first.
