* Tools & process *               -*-muse-*-

Mark is a tool guy. He believes that problems that must be solved many
times require an automatic solution. 

Why reinvest in learning how to do a series of step, only to have to
relearn them the next time?

Instead, invest the same energy creating a solution that can be
applied anytime you wish. Mark brings a unique blend of real-world
pragmatism and technical knowledge to each of these tools situations.
