* Invention *                 -*-muse-*-

When you have identified the goal and the building blocks that you
will use to reach the goal you are ready to invent.  It is time to
build the solution that will solve your problem.

Every solution has trade-offs.  Taking longer may make the project
cheaper.  Doing the work yourself will allow you to invest time
instead of money.  Buying a solution that someone else has created
will save you time but cost you money.

The essence of invention is figuring out how to match your specific
goals with the solution that you create.  To get this right you need a
clear sense of what trade-offs you are willing to live with.  A
solution that works for you may not be acceptable to someone else.
Create what is right for your situation.
