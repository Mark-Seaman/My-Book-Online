* Building a team *                 -*-muse-*-

Teams of people can accomplish much more than any single person, no
matter how talented they are.  But building community within a team
requires work.  Healthy relationships are the lubrication that keeps
the team moving forward toward its goals.  Much of your focus as a
leader must be to foster relationships with the people on your team.
Trust is the primary measure of the relational health of any
relationship.



Take a few moments and assess the trust level that is normal on your
team.  Do they trust you as their leader?  Do you trust them? Do
people trust each other?  What actions can you take as a leader to
cultivate a higher trust level?
