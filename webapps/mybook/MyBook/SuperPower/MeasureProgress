* Measure progress *                 -*-muse-*-

Your project plan allows you to directly measure the rate of your
progress.  From the first day of the project you will be able to
estimate how you are doing relative to how you thought you were doing.

Avoid the temptation to predict the future.  Trust in the measure of
the progress already made, not in the hope that you will be able to
make up lost time.  This tracking is based upon the reality of actual
performance rather than the desired outcome.  Therefore, it can not be
corrupted by pressure to tell a different story.

The best way to bring in a project that will be late is to reduce its
scope or add more resources to the project. Both of these changes to
the project plan must be done early enough in the project to affect
the outcome. This planning method makes it clear that changing the
plan late in a project only makes it later.

During the project you can never back up and do it over.  All you can
do is lay out the best possible plan from this point to the project
completion.  You can never affect the past, but you must control the
future.  Measuring progress throughout the project is the single most
important practice you can do.
