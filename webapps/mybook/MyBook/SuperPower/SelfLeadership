* Self-leadership *                 -*-muse-*-

It is impossible to be good at leading others without first mastering
yourself. This is not always an easy thing to do but it is
necessary. It is hard to inspire and motivate others if we can't even
inspire ourselves. This can sometimes take some energy, but it is well
worth the effort.

John C. Maxwell wrote an excellent book on this subject, entitled
'Today Matters'. In this book he describes the effects of the
commitments that we make in a number of different areas. Each
commitment that we make is established or undermined by our daily
habits. Once the emotion that produced the commitment fades, we are
left with these daily habits to carry us through.

There are twelve areas in which we make commitments that need to be
serviced daily. These are what Maxwell calls the Daily Dozen. They
include:

 * Attitude: Choose and display the right attitude.

 * Priority: Determine and act on important priorities.

 * Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines.

 * Family: Communicate and care for my family.

 * Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking.

 * Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments.

 * Finances: Make and properly manage money.

 * Faith: Deepen and live out my faith.

 * Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships.

 * Generosity: Plan for and model generosity.

 * Values: Embrace and practice good values.

 * Growth: Seek and experience improvements.

Self-leadership involves all of these unique aspects. As we seek to be
better leaders, we should start with ourselves. To be able to motivate
and influence others, we must first work on our own daily
habits. Sometimes this is the most difficult step in leadership.

Take a few minutes and score yourself against these personal
commitments. How do you fare? Where would you like to grow?
