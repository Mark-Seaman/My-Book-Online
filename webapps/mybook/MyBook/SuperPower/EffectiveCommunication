* How Effective is Your Communication? *                 -*-muse-*-

It is time for an honest self-assessment. Many groups that I work with
continue to struggle with one major problem. 'How can we communicate
more effectively?' This question resonates throughout both businesses
and non-profit organizations.

This issue of communication can be broken into audience,
message, tools, and process.  Consider conducting a simple
self-assessment of your communications. This can be done in a few
minutes by asking three questions in each of these key areas. This is
a very straightforward process that anyone can do. However, very few
organizations that I work with have ever really asked themselves these
questions.

By answering these questions you will be far ahead of most
organizations. You will be aware of communication issues that exist
all around you. This will enable you to begin developing a systematic
approach to communicate the important details that others need to
know.


**Audience** - Assess who your audience is:

 * Do we communicate often enough?

 * Am I reaching everyone that should be informed?

 * What do they already understand (or question) about this subject? 


**Message** - Questions to ask about the content of your communication:

 * Is the message itself clear and compelling?

 * Is there a clear call to action?

 * Does the form of the message enhance or detract receptivity? 


**Tools for communication**- Make sure that your tools and methods are effective:

 * Do I use a systematic approach to communication to ensure that everyone is informed?

 * Do I allow for individual learning styles (eg. web sites, meetings, email, webinars, podcasts)?

 * Are all the forms of communication integrated and coordinated? 


**Process of communication** - Treat communication like any other business process:

 * How do people respond with feedback and concerns?

 * How do we measure the effectiveness of the communication?

 * Is the communication intended to be one-way or two-way and do the tools make this possible?
