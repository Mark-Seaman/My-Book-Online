* Preferred communication *                 -*-muse-*-

Each person has their own style of communication.  We also have our
own preference for the methods of communication.  Some people prefer
face-to-face interactions while other prefer phone calls, emails, or
group meetings. 

It is important to understand the preferred methods of the people that
you work most closely with.  You may not always be able to accommodate
their preferences.  But knowing what works for them will allow you to
select the most effective method for each interaction.

People typically know what types of communications work for them. You
can simply ask someone what type of communication works most
effectively with them.

When you are planning to communicate with a large group of people it
is best to use multiple channels at the same time.  You will find that
some people will respond to a specific channel but not others.

The goal is to be as flexible in your communications as possible.
This increases the odds that your message will be heard.  We have a
constant stream of messages bombarding us.  If you want to be heard
above the dim then get creative about how you communicate.
