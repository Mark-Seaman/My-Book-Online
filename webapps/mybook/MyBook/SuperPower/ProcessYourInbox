Email is the primary way the people communicate these days.  Your
email in-box then becomes your communications queue.  In order to
effectively communicate with people, you must process your queue at
least once a day.



I recommend that when you process your email in-box that you respond
to every message immediately or consciously defer it for later.  You
can easily do this by moving it to an action folder within your email
software.  These items can them be further organized by priority or
subject matter.



There are many actions that each of us have pending at any point in
time.  But these items that require some future action should never
cause us to lose track of incoming email.



Any modern email program also has methods for sorting emails into
folders as they arrive.  Many emails are simply providing background
information and are low priority.  They should be treated as such by
the email handling system that you create.  Use the tools that you
have at your disposal to make your life easier.
