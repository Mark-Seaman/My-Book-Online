* Project management *                 -*-muse-*-

Here is an outline of a simple set of practices that you can use to
manage almost any project. The objective of this process is to have a
predictable system for managing projects that sets clear expectations,
provide real-time progress updates throughout the project, provides
early warning of issues, uses just enough process to keep things
running smoothly.

The process involves several stages and for each stage there are some
keys to success that you should follow.

**Project Planning**

 * Create a wiki for project communication
 * Develop and collaborate with clients on project plan
 * Develop weekly iteration plan (show running stuff every week)
 * Develop method for getting feedback
 * Train workers on using the project wiki and project tools

**Project Execution** 

 * Use wiki daily for project communication with workers (what did I do?, what am I doing?, what are the challenges?)
 * Use IM for instant interaction and task coordination
 * Create work cycle around the weekly client meeting (show result, get direction, highlight issues)
 * Always have work viewable by client
 * Fix defects before adding new functionality
 * Perform tasks in iterations

**Project completion**

 * Get confirmation of completed work
 * Confirm terms of ongoing support
 * Complete payment of workers
