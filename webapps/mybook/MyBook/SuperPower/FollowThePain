* Follow the pain *                 -*-muse-*-

If you want to find the area that needs the most improvement, then pain can be great indicator.
Every situation has areas of utter frustration and anguish.  These do not hide;they are in your face
each an every day.  This works in our favor if we let it.  We do not have to search to know where
the next big improvement needs to happen. It finds us.

Take a minute now to identify the next area that needs work in your life (or the next area of work
that needs life).  Phrase the desired outcome that you would like in less than five words.
Examples: "Improve satisfaction scores", "Eliminate unproductive meetings", "TPS reports on-time".

This is an important step in solving the problem. Naming a particular issue give us a certain
resolve to improve it.  Think of this as creating an internal commitment to make a difference in the
way things work.  This is the first step in making an objective.

Measure the pain in the amount of needless money, time, and stress that is wasted. Attempt to
quantify these, so that you can measure any improvements that you make. Your change should bring
relief in the area of the greatest pain.  This is also your greatest opportunity.

As you make changes evaluate the impact.  Does the change reduce the pain?  Does it have unexpected
side effects?  An honest assessment is essential to achieving the desired results.

The actual results of the change should be compared to the expected results.  Did you get the impact
that you hoped for?  Or is something blocking the desired result?  Is this problem still worth
working on or is there a better opportunity for improvement elsewhere?

The insights that come from this type of evaluation are very useful.  They will help guide your
future improvements.
