Things change.  Then they change some more.  Change is constant.  You
need planning methods that recognize this.  Large projects need even
more flexibility, while maintaining the ability to coordinate all of
the different dependencies.



You should review your plans weekly to keep them fresh.  If you need
to coordinate between multiple people, departments, and companies,
then the best way to do this is to identify key deliverables.  Each
deliverable represents work that one group needs to provide to another
group on a certain date to keep the project on track.



These dates should not move around much since this can cause a great
deal of pain.  Constantly be watching the key deliverables and
estimating the likelihood of keeping that commitment.  For those items
that are in jeopardy assess the impact that a late delivery will have
on the overall project.  Figure out mitigation plans when they are
required.



Don't hide in denial.  When a part of the project threatens the whole,
figure out how you can lessen the impact of this failure.  Don't let
one domino knock over all of the rest.  Don't let one thread unravel
the entire sweater.



Fix the issue and move consistently to the goal.  Make a new plan,
Stan.  Remember, the planning is much more important than the plan.
Always recognize reality.  Hope is not a valid planning method.
