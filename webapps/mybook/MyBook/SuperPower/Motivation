* Motivation *                 -*-muse-*-

Probably the most important aspect of leadership is giving people a
reason to push forward.  Everyone will lose motivation at one point or
another.  The job of a leader is to help each person understand that
their contribution is vital and appreciated.



Leaders typically ask people to make sacrifices.  In return, there
must be a reward.  Asking someone to make a sacrifice with no
perceived benefit is simply foolish.



Keep in mind that the benefits, need not be monetary.  In fact the
most important rewards are never about money.  Leaders must become
creative in understanding the people they are leading and providing
the things that they most value.



These can be as intangible as a future opportunity or recognition for
a job well done.  They may also be concrete rewards like a time off or
a bonus.  Think about creative ways to meet the needs of the people on
your team.
