* Expectations *                 -*-muse-*-

People often expect you to read their minds.  This can be a dangerous situation when expectations
are involved.  Put effort into understanding the expectations of others.  Avoid those rude awakenings.

Verify that expectations are shared.  Ask others what they expect.  You might be surprised by the
answer.  When you hear someone else describe what you believe should happen, then you are much
closer to agreement than when you state your own assumptions and ask for agreement.

Pay close attention to any nuance that you did not expect to hear.  For example, "That design will
be complete on Tuesday, except for the rubilator", is their way of telling you that the rubilator is
not included.  On the other hand, if you asked, "Will the design be done next Tuesday?", you would
likely not learn this additional information.
