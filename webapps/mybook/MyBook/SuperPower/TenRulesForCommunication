* Ten rules for communication *                 -*-muse-*-

Effective and strategic communication should be done intentionally. A
communication system can be developed as any other system. With this
in mind, there are 10 objectives for strategic communication.

1. Everyone hears the same thing.

2. People receive information in a form they can digest.

3. The technology delivers messages automatically.

4. The message is designed to advance trust and commitment.

5. All messages have objectives.

6. Results are measured consistently.

7. Web sites are used for 'pulling' information and email for 'pushing' it.

8. Format is a compelling part of the message.

9. Private communication is used to refine public communication.

10. Incremental improvement is a constant process.
