* Leadership *                 -*-muse-*-

Leaders influence others. Without good leaders much less gets done.
Leadership is the ability to influence others.  Great leaders can
inspire, motivate and coordinate groups of people to accomplish
extraordinary goals.

The leader is the one that people follow.  This does not happen by an
appointment.  Effective leadership happens when the leader wins the
trust of others.  True leadership is earned.  If people choose to
follow your influence then you have become a leader in actuality
rather than in name only.  Trust is the most basic currency of
leadership.

This section of Shrinking-world.org is dedicated to helping you be
more effective as a leader.  You will find helpful tips and ideas that
will challenge your thinking on the issues of leadership.
