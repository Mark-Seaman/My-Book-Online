* Evaluate effectiveness *                 -*-muse-*-

The primary goal of investing in non-profit work is not for us to feel
good.  It is true that there is personal emotional benefit from
serving others.  But the ultimate goal of good works is to produce a
beneficial result for those being served.



It is time that we think more strategically about doing good.  I
admire the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for this reason.  They
not only invest sacrificially to make sure that needs are being met;
they also pay careful attention to effectiveness of the programs.



Non-profit organizations are notoriously wasteful.  If the good
needing done is worth doing then the stakes are even higher than if it
didn't really matter at all.  In other words, if the end is important
than the means is also important.



Take a few minutes to ask yourself some hard questions about what you
are doing.  Are you maximizing the benefit for the resources that you
invest?  Can you optimize how you serve others to make an even bigger
impact?
