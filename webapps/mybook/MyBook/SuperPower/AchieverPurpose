* Purpose *                 -*-muse-*-

Finding your life's purpose can be tricky.  Many people never actually
figure this one out. They simply wonder through life hoping to survive
but are not totally sure what the destination is.

There are no easy steps to discover your purpose in live.  It is more
like an adventure that you live or a game that you play, were the goal
of the game is to figure out what the goal of the game is.

Start by finding a meaningful cause.  When have you had the most joy
when serving someone else?  This may be a clear indicator that you
should invest more time in that activity.

Another great way to help discover is to explore your areas of
passion.  What naturally sparks your interest?  What would it be like
if you were allowed to do what you do all day long?  How can you serve
others and still do what you love?

True purpose always has a component of helping others.  It is not
merely about achieving personal goals, and pursuing individual
interests.  It must be about more that us alone.

Communicate your passion.  Dialog with others that you trust.  Tell
them about your dreams and get their feedback.  Those closest to you
may be able to give you some surprising insight.

Each day you are writing your life story. Consider carefully what plot
lines you want to pursue. You can not control many of the
circumstances that surround, but you can control the responses that you
have to them.

Developing your life story does not happen overnight.  It takes time.
It requires trial and error.  It must be a process of exploration.
Your purpose is unique to you and so it is not something that someone
else can discover for you.

Most people do not truly discover their purpose until they are in their
late thirties or early forties. It is a process that cannot be
rushed. Experience and reflection is the shortest way to understand
the meaning of your life.
