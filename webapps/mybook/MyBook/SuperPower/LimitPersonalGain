* Limit personal gain *                 -*-muse-*-

It is very disheartening to see people start off to make a difference
for others and then to lose sight of that initial goal.  Many
organizations are set up to serve others only to end up serving only
themselves.  Corruption takes a hold quickly but subtlety.



One way to combat this values drift is to intentionally set up
explicit goals that limit personal gain.  This serves as a reminder of
the original goals.  It provides tension that highlights abuse early
so that it can be corrected.
