You can perform as many tasks well as you have brains to manage them.
Multi-tasking ability is a myth. Splitting your attention between many
activities seriously undermines your performance.  Talking on the cell
phone while drinking and driving is certain to get you into
trouble. Choose one of those activities and do it well.  Then do the
next activity when you can fully devote your full attention to
it. Single-tasking is much more efficient.



Identify the most important project on your list. This may be the most
urgent one or one that will bring the greatest sense of
accomplishment.  This need to be your main focus each day.  There are
other activities that you should also make progress on, but make sure
to advance your primary project today.  Clearly identifying the most
important project will cause you to make more rapid progress than you
would otherwise make.



80/20 rule states that 80 of the problems come from 20 of the causes.
80% of the revenue comes from 20% of the customers.  Results are
disproportionate and lopsided.  Understand how you can take advantage
of this phenomenon to put more energy into those activities that give
you the biggest return on your investment.
