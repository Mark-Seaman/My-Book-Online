* The Need For Innovation *  -*-muse-*- 

Everyone needs to grow and improve. To stop growing means beginning to die. Growth can come in many
different forms, but a commitment to learning and improving is absolutely essential. What is true at
the personal level is also of organizations.

Every business or non-profit organization exists to produce value for its members, customers, share
holders, or those it serves. Growth means producing increasing levels of value over time.

To accomplish this, you must establish practices that are both effective and
efficient. Effectiveness is doing the right things so that the desired benefits are actually
realized. Efficiency is doing things right to minimize the cost. It is possible for an organization
to achieve one of these objectives without the other, but both are necessary to produce the results
at a reasonable cost.

In order to constantly improve effectiveness and efficiency an organization must commit to a pattern
of constant innovation. It needs to examine what it is doing and how it is doing it. This
examination uncovers gaps between what actually is and what should be. Innovation happens when we
close this gap.

The first step in creating a cycle of constant innovation is to make a commitment to seeing it
through.  Choosing to embark on a journey of continuous improvement means that you will be learning
what is needed to take your organization to the next level.

We will be looking at the pieces of the innovation cycle: Learn, Plan, Invent, and Teach.  This
integrated approach will be applied incrementally and continuously to produce the results you need.

In the next few articles I will show you how to create a constant innovation cycle that will allow
your organization to continuously grow. By implementing these practices now, you will be able to
build upon what you have already accomplished and improve areas of neglect.
