* Your Communication System *                  -*-muse-*-

Select a system that delivers your email that will always work without
you ever having to worry about it.  I recommend Gmail.  You can set up
a free account that always works and has excellent spam filtering.
You can get it to automatically sort your mail for you.

Also develop good habits about how the email is processed.  Over your career this will save you
thousands of hours.

Manage your communications effectively!  Problems with your communications system will affect every
aspect of your business and much of your personal life. If you don't have an effective communication
system in place then you should consider this the first priority for your attention.

An efficient communication system is one that requires minimal attention after the initial
setup. Email is the heart of your system. You must be able to completely trust that every message
sent arrives successfully, to the intended owner. You also need to ensure that real messages are not
falsely recognized or that unfiltered spam does not obscure real messages. Spam filtering is an arms
race and many solutions that people use are completely unworkable.

The best overall solution that I have ever seen for email is Google's gmail. I have around 20
different email addresses that are used for different purposes. All my mail is delivered and
filtered at gmail. I can read my mail from any computer that is connected to the internet or on my
phone. All the mail is managed by Google so you don't need to worry about synchronizing it across
multiple computers.

It is amazingly offered free of charge, since it is supported by advertisements. This is one of the
greatest bargains in the high-tech industry. There is now no value is creating your own email
server. If you haven't done it already sign up for your gmail account. You'll be glad you did. From
now on the world-class email system that you need is free!
