Create a personal dashboard!  When you arrive at work and turn on your
computer you need to see a dashboard which tells you how things are
going and what you should work on next. Unfortunately many of us have
a large collection of dashboards with no meaningful integration
between them.

I've been exploring this idea as part of creating a personal productivity platform. When I get ready
to work, I type "dashboard" and magic happens on my computer. A text editor is run with my work agenda,
accomplishments, projects, and future projects. A browser is run with all of my web-based
applications. This includes email, task list, calendar, and twitter.

Everything is laid out in front of me to provide a great starting point. By running two actual
applications (each with four or five tabs of information), all of my information is readily
accessible with a single click.

Most people spend an enormous amount of time just clicking around through files trying to find
content that will get the next task started. Consider creating your own personal dashboard that
holds all of your indispensable information.
