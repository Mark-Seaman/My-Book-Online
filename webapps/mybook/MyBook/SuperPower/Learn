* Learn *                 -*-muse-*-

Learning is the ability to embrace something new: a concept, an idea, an understanding.  We don't
quit learning when we graduate from college.  In many ways that is when the real learning begins.

Learning is an attitude where you are interested in the world that surrounds you.  There are endless
interests to pursue.  It is impossible to explore everything.  Prioritize the things that you most
wanter to learn.  Set aside time on a regular basis to embrace the topics of interest.

There are two basic types of learning (structured and random).  Some things that you learn require
in-depth study and cannot be done unless you have a clear outcome in mind.  But there is also less
formal learning that involves sampling various topics and discovering things along the way.  Budget
your learning time so that you can experience some of each.

Learning is a growth experience.  It expands your current knowledge and enlarges your view of the
world.  It can also be a humbling experience as well.  Einstein once said, "As the circle of light
expands, so does the circumference of darkness around it."

Learning means that we are embracing new concepts and new ideas.  It is a fundamental aspect of
personal growth.  When we learn we become more aware and appreciative of the world around us.  To
learn is to be truly alive.

A thirst for lifelong learning is at the core of all intellectual achievement.
