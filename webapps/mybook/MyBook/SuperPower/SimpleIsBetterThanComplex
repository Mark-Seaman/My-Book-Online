* Simple is better than complex *                 -*-muse-*-

People have natural tendencies when it comes to planning.  Some tend
to over-plan everything, while others tend to reject all planning.
The true value of planning is not in the resulting plan, but the
process of thinking through the issues.



When you plan, try to create the simplest possible plan that will
work.  This will be your most effective path forward.  If you are
going to the grocery store the plan that will work will be a list of
items to purchase.  On the other hand, if you are building a ship, the
simplest plan that will work will be huge.



Every project has a fundamental complexity associated with it.  Your
planning should match the complexity of the problem that you are
trying to solve.  My experience shows that many large projects are
over-planned, meaning that the plan for the project is much more
complex than it needs to be.



Your first job in planning is to figure out the appropriate scope of
your project and match the scope of the plan to its complexity.  Start
by considering previous projects that are similar.  What parts of the
planning process worked for you?  What areas should be updated to
match the new project?  Try to build on past experience rather than
starting from scratch.
