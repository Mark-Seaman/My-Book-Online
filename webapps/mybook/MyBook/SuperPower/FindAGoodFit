* Find a good fit *                 -*-muse-*-

The primary difference between achieving mediocre results and
fantastic ones is the match between strengths and opportunities.
Finding the situation that fits your strengths gives you the
opportunity to excel.  Life is too short to waste it by not finding
opportunities that are a good fit for you.



Each person has their own "super-power".  Find yours and use it for
good.  Everyone will be thankful that you did.
