* Experiment *                 -*-muse-*-

During the development stage of the innovation cycle, you must try a
lot of different things.  Find out what works and what fails.  Create
a series of low-cost experiments to try several different ways of
doing the same thing.

The goal of this phase is to learn about the problem space not create
the entire new solution.  Because you are trying a lot of new things
you must keep each experiment very simple.  These experiments should
be focused on those areas where you are lacking key pieces of
information.

Start this process by making a short list of what you don't know.  Now
create a list of things that will help you find a solution to the
missing pieces of information.

Consider the following example to illustrate this.  Assume that you
want to create a web site.  Start by assessing what you know and what
you don't know.  Do you need to find a new web host?  Do you need to
select a tool for creating the site? Do you need to hire someone to do
the work for you?

Each of these key decisions will have several alternative answers.
Experiment with different solutions until you think that you know
enough to make the call.  Once you have made the decision it is time
to build the solution.  You are ready to invent!
