* Understand your strengths *                 -*-muse-*-

Many people can go an entire lifetime without truly discovering what
they excel at.  This is a tragedy since much of our happiness is
dependent on exercising our strengths.  There is an excellent book by
Marcus Buckingham, called "Now, Discover Your Strengths".  This book
will help you to identify areas of excellence. It will give you some
valuable guidance in how to spend more time doing what you are well
suited for.



Remember a time when you were so engaged in what you were doing that
you completely lost track of time.  You were consumed with your
activity.  You were totally engrossed in the moment.  These golden
moments reveal what you are passionate about.  What if you could spend
twice the amount of time in this type of activity.



Look for opportunities to do what you love.  Being passionate about
something is a great indicator of a strength.  Understand the specific
situation that really lights your fire and look for similar activities
that you can participate in.



Other activities simply drain the life right out of you.  These are
weaknesses, and are the opposite of strengths.  Rather than giving you
excitement and passion they drain those things away.  Consciously
avoid these areas of weakness and attempt to shift time from
activities that weaken you areas where you are already strong.
