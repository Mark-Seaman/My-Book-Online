technology for simplifying your life. Here you will find usable tips

many ideas for leaders who wish to expand their leadership capacity.

As a software engineer, I naturally tend to solve many real-world
solutions by using software. For example, any task that requires a
repetition of steps can be automated. The steps can be performed
without having to remember the details of how they are down. All that
you need to do is express when you want the automatic task
performed. This will trigger the desired task automatically.

To illustrate this, consider a backup task. To automate this task you
need to tell the computer what files to backup and where they should
be stored. Once this is done then you just tell the backup to
start. The details are saved inside the backup script, not
remembered. Furthermore, you can tell your computer that you wish to
perform this task every weekday at 9:00 P.M. From then on you will
have automatic backup without any further attention on your part.
