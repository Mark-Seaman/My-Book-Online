Shrinking World Guide is published by Shrinking World Organization,
whose purpose is to offer advice to help you thrive in the modern
world. The world is a much smaller place than it was only ten years
ago. The forces of globalization, mass communication, and easy travel
have an astounding impact on our everyday lives. Our lives are
interlinked as never before.

Changes no longer affect just a single company or nation. They are
truly global. I have spent most of my career working for a large
multi-national technology company. Change is accelerating and many
people are not prepared for the impact that it will have on them.

The Shrinking World Guide will help you be more effective in this
modern world, by providing you with high-quality, free advice. You
will understand better how technology can help you simplify everyday
tasks or eliminate them completely. 

The purpose of Shrinking World Guide is to summarize information on
Technology, Productivity, and Leadership. These three important areas
come together under the theme of "Having a maximum impact in the
modern world"
