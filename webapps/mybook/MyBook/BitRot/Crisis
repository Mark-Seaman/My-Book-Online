* The Crisis of Bit Rot *                 -*-muse-*-


Everyone wants a software system to be flexible, but this does not naturally occur.  The only way to
make a system flexible, is to constantly flex it.

Have you ever worked in a shared space and noticed how messy it becomes over time?  This is because
no one feels a sense of ownership. As code has many authors it becomes more like a messy public
space than a sign of craftsmanship.

Different people have different goals for a system.  They also have different programming and design
styles that they inflict upon the overall system.  The more authors that a software system has, then
the more dramatic the mess becomes.

Eventually, the code takes on so much technical debt that it can not be maintained for a reasonable
cost.   At this point the entire system is scrapped and a new one is built to replace it. 

There are a variety of reasons given for replacing the old system, but the actual cause is that the
system has been taken over by "bit rot".  

Software neglect can result in enormous costs to a business. This problem is incredibly pervasive in
all industries.  Bit rot threatens to destroys our core business value.
