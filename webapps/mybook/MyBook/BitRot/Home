* Most software systems are in serious danger!  Is yours? *                 -*-muse-*-

As a software consultant, I help companies fight bit rot.
Over time software degrades until it is no longer useful.

There are proven techniques to fix flaws that grow in systems resulting from changes over time.

The natural decay can be reversed but it takes effort. 
I teach development teams how to fight bit rot by adopting best practices.

All software systems begin the process of decay shortly after they are created. Eventually the
damage caused by the corruption will totally undermine the system itself.  Fortunately, this slow
process of decay can be reversed.

About 80% of the software systems are seriously compromised and 90% of those companies will replace
their systems with new ones.

Replacement is not cost effective.
I show companies how to extend the lifetime of their existing software.

This web site will teach you how to recognize the effects of bit rot and give you steps to
counteract it.  Software is very expensive to create and should be protected.  Anyone can learn the
techniques for fighting bit rot.

Commit to fight software decay today.
