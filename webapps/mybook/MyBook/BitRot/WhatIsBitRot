* What Is Bit Rot ? *                 -*-muse-*-

Software is almost always created with high quality.   But it lives in a constantly changing world.
As software ages it must constantly be changed to match the new world.  If this does not occur then
the software stop working properly.

Many of the problems are subtle at first. But over time, become catastopic. These problems result
from changes to the outside system, platform that this system runs on, or the functionality of the
system itself.  All three of these sources gather to form the problem of bit rot.

If the software changes cannot keep up with the changing environment then problems grow and multiply
within the software.  Bit rot grows dramatically with time.

The other problem with aging software is that the original team members slowly fade away and the
knowledge required to keep the system updated is lost.  As this happens the system becomes more
brittle and fragile.  Eventually the system becomes so unstable that it no longer performs the
function that it was created for.
