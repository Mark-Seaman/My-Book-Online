The world is a much smaller place than it was only ten years ago.  The forces of globalization, mass communication, and easy travel have an astounding impact on our everyday lives.  Our lives are interlinked as never before.\r\n\r\nChanges no longer affect just a single company or nation.  They are truly global.  I have spent most of my career working for a large multi-national technology company.  Change is accelerating and many people are not prepared for the impact that it will have on them.\r\n\r\nThe Shrinking World Guide will help you be more effective in this modern world, by providing you with high-quality, free advice.  You will understand better how technology can help you simplify everyday tasks or eliminate them completely.  The purpose of Shrinking World Guide is to summarize information on Technology, Productivity, and Leadership.  These three important areas come together under the theme of \"Having a maximum impact in the modern world\".\r\n\r\n",

You will be able to find improvements that will make your life simpler.\r\n\r\nIt is organized as a branching tree of topics that provide increasing levels of detail. An overview of each topic is given with a short description. You dive in deeper by following the link to more detailed subtopics within the guide. \r\n\r\nThis site has a structure that helps to maintain regular habits of authoring. These same policies also help to organize the discussions into a form that is very useful to the readers.\r\n\r\nShrinking World Guide is here to serve you by providing a steady stream of high-quality tips that will make your life more enjoyable.  As you have ideas that you would like to contribute then contact me using the contact info on this web site.\r\n\r\nNew content is added about three times each week. Each article consists of one or two paragraphs of text. Pointers to other topics may also be included. This means that you may be able to see the direction of the details that are yet to be written about before they exist.\r\n\r\nIt is quite useless to have a web site proclaim that it is under construction. Unlike books, which have long distribution lead times, web sites are almost never complete. They are always within a state of development.\r\n\r\nThe goal with a web site is to make it useful as quickly as possible. Once it is functional it should remain in that state. People get very frustrated with site that are not always working properly. The goal of this web site is to always be useful and always be growing in an incremental way.\r\n\r\nEvery topic can always be broken down into smaller topics. Experience has shown me that if I truly want to understand a subject then it should be described as four roughly equal subtopics. Testing this breakdown requires exploring one more level below each of the legs.\r\n\r\nThe 4x4 pattern says that each topic can be broken into four, and that each of them can be broken into four. The means that to describe a subject requires decomposing into a structure of 21 related topics.\r\n\r\nHaving done the hard work it is very simple to write a paragraph explaining each idea in the outline. The 4x4 pattern is the main writing technique used in building Shrinking-world.org. I encourage you to try out this process on your own favorite writing project.\r\n\r\nAs a software engineer I love tools. The difficulty comes when I spend too much of my project time trying out new software methods and tools. Shrinking World Guide is a writing venue where content is king. When writing here I will resist the temptation to switch tools.\r\n\r\nThat is part of the reason that I chose to use media wiki as the writing platform. I have also written a web publishing tool called MyBookOnline.org. But writing my own publishing tool will mean that most of the focus will be lost for the writing content. ",

To be a good writer you must believe that there are people out there that would benefit from your message.  \r\n\r\nYour approach to writing should be built around the needs of your audience.  How can you best communicate the key ideas that you have?  What is the best form to engage your readers?  This all starts by having a clear understanding of your audience.  What are their hopes and dreams?  What do they fear most?  How can your message connect with those hopes and fears?\r\n\r\nWithout this clear understanding of your audience and your purpose in writing you will flounder.  It will be difficult to maintain motivation.  Your clarity will suffer because you will write for a different audience every time you sit down.\r\n\r\nShare wisdom from your experience.  Some lessons must be learned personally. However, many lessons can be gleaned from the experience of others. This allows you to get the benefit without having to experience the pain. This web site will help you recognize patterns and aid you in deciding the best path forward. \r\n\r\nSharing experiences can be a great way to help others. Shrinking-world.org is intended to be a great resource for ideas to help you out. Here you will find best practices in the areas of Technology, Productivity, and Leadership.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use this material in any way that you wish. If you do find something of use be sure to give credit to the source. \r\n\r\nA good name is a valuable thing. It is worth spending a lifetime investing in helping others. This is the essence of a good reputation. It is the belief that you care about others and not just yourself.\r\n\r\nConsider activities that you might do that primarily benefit someone else. Where are you currently investing your life in serving others. The return is inevitable, but not immediate.\r\n\r\nShrinking World Organization was created to help others. We work to ensure that the quality of the information posted is professional, accurate, and high quality. This is a necessary part of building a reputation.

If you want to improve your skill as an author then figure out your primary venue.\r\n\r\nSet up a place to share your writing with others. Build an expectation in your readers by creating new material on a regular basis. This also increases your motivation in times where it is naturally low.\r\n\r\nFigure out the frequency that is write for you. If you are not writing regularly today then pick a frequency that is much lower than you thnk you can do. Once you make this choice then stick to it.\r\n\r\nIt does no good for you to commit to writing an article every week only to deliver the first three articles before quitting.

The web site is filled with concrete suggestions for helping you to fully utilize technology to simplify your life. There are also many ideas for leaders who wish to expand their leadership capacity. \r\n\r\nAs a software engineer, I naturally tend to solve many real-world solutions by using software. For example, any task that requires a repetition of steps can be automated. The steps can be performed without having to remember the details of how they are down. All that you need to do is express when you want the automatic task performed. This will trigger the desired task automatically.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, consider a backup task. To automate this task you need to tell the computer what files to backup and where they should be stored. Once this is done then you just tell the backup to start. The details are saved inside the backup script, not remembered. Furthermore, you can tell your computer that you wish to perform this task every weekday at 9:00 P.M. From then on you will have automatic backup without any further attention on your part. \r\n\r\n    Shrinking World Guides are made for busy people. It is set up so that you can spend a few minutes poking around and gain a key insight that might enable you to save several hours of work. The content is written for goal oriented people who are always looking for ways to achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\r\n\r\nSome people just love exploring new technologies. We like to investigate things as they appear and try to determine the advantages and a limitations of new tools.

You can teach a computer to repeat the steps to your solution. If you create an automatic solution then you don't need to remember all of the steps that you used to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThis is best illustrated by an example.  You need to backup your files on your computer so that when disaster strikes you can repair them.  It is possible to have a series of steps to copy the files from your hard disk to a backup CD.  If you decide to do this manually it will get done three times: once when you start it and then two more times before you begin neglecting it ever-after.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, automatic backups need to be set up initially, but can run unattended from that time on.  Consider automating any task that you perform on a regular basis.  Tasks can be automated by using software that someone else has written.  You can also learn a few simple ways to set up your own automatic tasks.  This takes a little more effort initially but also gives you a lot of flexibility.\r\n",

This is the essence of a simple lifestyle.  One of life's greatest mysteries is learning how to live for the things that matter.\r\n\r\nCreating a simple lifestyle does not happen automatically.  In fact the opposite is true.  If we let things occur naturally we take on more and more commitments until we are overwhelmed by the expectations of others, and our own aspirations.\r\n\r\nA simple life requires thought and discipline. It comes from systematically evaluating what is really important.  When you know that you can try to eliminate, or at least reduce, everything else.  This is a journey of self-discovery that will produce many benefits for you.\r\n\r\nA simple lifestyle is not easy to achieve precisely because it requires a great deal of analysis.  By default many things that we don't value creep into our lives.  They crowd out what really matters.  The motivation to simplify comes from a realization that life can easily pass us by without ever experiencing the things of most value.  This is the source of true regret.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding ourselves is the key to simplifying things. Each of us have different gifting and personal characteristics.  There are activities that play to our strengths. When we know the types of situations where our strengths can shine we can consciously look for more of them.  Simplifying our lives include being more selective about activities that we are involved in.\r\n\r\nSimplifying is a process.  We don't just wake up one morning and notice that we have a simple lifestyle.  Instead each few days we make a decision to make a small change.  \r\n\r\nWe become intentional about the way that we live.  We  choose to give our time to the people and activities that we value.  We stubbornly refuse to invest time in activities that do not yield fruit.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips to help you in your search of a simpler life.  We live in a world and a time that puts constant pressure on us.  We need more stuff and need to be involved in more things, or so we are told.  There comes a time for us to say no to these demands and reshape our lives.\r\n\r\nCreating a simpler life is primarily about making choices.  Instead of trying to meet all possible goals, we focus on those that we feel most passionate about.  Clearly everything is not equally important to us.  Simplifying means being more selective about how we spend our time and our money.\r\nA simple life is one where our time is spend on the things that we love with the people that we love.  In order to maximize the activities that produce the highest benefit we must minimize other activities that are less worthy of the investment.\r\n\r\nLikewise, a simple life also involves how we spend our money.  Some things we invest in get us closer to our goals while others do not.  Many items that we buy do not produce the value that justifies their cost.  Money spent requires an investment in time to work to cover the cost.  \r\n\r\nBecause money can be converted into time (and the counterpart), we can see that our handling of both time and money are interlinked.  In order to simplify our lives we need to limit the commitments and purchases that we make to the essentials.  \r\n\r\nFind those areas to commit extra resources where the passion is the highest.  The extra investment in those activities will come by reducing the low value ones. Selection is the key to simplifying your life.\r\n\r\nMake a list of your top five goals.  What would make your life feel more fulfilling?  Are you investing in these areas?  Can you get more of this?  Are you willing to reduce the other less fulfilling activities to get more of your top goals?  The journey will be fun.",

The specifics vary but each of us need to find techniques that enable us to be more effective at using our limited personal resources.  Time, energy, money, and health can so easily be squandered.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal written about personal management.  This can sometimes seem so complicated that it produces inaction.  Personal management is actually quite easy but it takes practice to become a master.\r\n\r\nPlanning occurs in different time frames.  Already today, you have been thinking about actions that you need to do and projects with loose ends that need attending.  You have probably also been thinking about the roles that you play and dreams and fears of the future.  Your planning needs to embrace all of the different ideas.\r\n\r\nPlanning is simply decision making about the future.   It starts by looking at risks and values.    The risks are bad things that might happen and your job is to make decisions that will reduce the negative impact.  The values are what you desire most out of life.  Identifying these hopes and fears helps you create a path that gives you the greatest possible well-being.\r\n\r\nA good place to start in planning is to start with what you value.  Make a list of the things in your life that are particularly dear to you.    This will help to focus your attention on what really matters.\r\n\r\nYou can also look at where you spend your time and money.  Is there a gap between these two views?  If so then it will be the source of a lot of emotional discord.  If you treasure vacation, but haven't taken one in twelve years then you are in trouble.  Time to begin planning your vacation.  If you value education, but never got your high school degree then you are certain to be in turmoil.\r\n\r\nBefore you can do effective short-term planning it is important to do this self-assessment.  Is what you value directly correlated with how you are spending your life.  If there is a disconnect then it must be addressed before dealing with other planning details.",

            "body": "If you use computers all day long as a part of your job, you need to think about how you use them strategically.  Most people can save at least 30% of their time spent on the computer.  If you spend 30 hours or more a week you can expect to save around ten hours each week by being clever about your computer tasks.\r\n\r\nThis guide will show you the steps that you should take to gain this savings.  Of course you will need to spend some time up front to setup your tools.  But the one-time investment will continue paying dividends for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to adopt a viewpoint of solving problems in a more general way.  When you encounter a task that you commonly do, think about what kind of tool would let you side-step this problem in the future.  This mind set will serve you in almost any situation.  You can see repetative tasks a areas where your process must be improved.\r\n\r\nWe will look at implementing this approach in four different essential areas:\r\n* information system\r\n* learning system\r\n* planning system\r\n* communication system\r\n\r\nWe will be looking at each of these key systems and walking through the process of understanding the core needs and building tools that help you work at peak efficiency.  Along the way we will explore some general priniciples that we help you improve your work style and specific trade-offs that are unique to each of these systems.\r\n\r\nLet's start with an overview of each of these key systems that we all use and discuss the overall approach to improve them.  \r\n\r\nYour information system deals with how you manage knowledge.  Computers are great tools to manage information, but like any tool they require some skill and training to get them to work properly.  Sometimes computers can be a necessary evil that we tolerate only because we need them so badly.\r\n\r\nYour computer can actually be a huge point of leverage when dealing with information.  This guide will show you how to setup an information system that work much more efficiently that a hodge-podge collection of less efficient systems.  The goal is to have all of your knowledge accessible from a single system that has many smaller pieces that work together.  When your system is working you should be able to locate any information that youhave within seconds, not minutes.  You should also be able to guarantee that no disaster will destroy your data.\r\n\r\nLearning is an important part of any job that dealing with knowledge.  We expand our usefulness by learning new skills and capabilities.  You need a system that will support your learning activities and allow you to track your progress.  You need an easy and instantly accessible system to capture ideas for new books, articles, internet sites, etc.. \r\n\r\nThis guide will show you how to start with a very simple system and expand it as your needs grow.  Many people don't know where to start in establishing their learning goals.  We will walk though that as well.\r\n\r\nYour planning system is how you keep your activities on track.  Everybody has a system that they use.  You can have a very effective personal planning system that is still very simple.  In fact the most effective system must be simple.  Otherwise, it will fall into disuse.  A system that doesn't work is worse than no system at all.\r\n\r\nYour communication system deals with how you interact with others and the tools that you use to communicate.  Twenty years ago the primary tool was the telephone, ten year ago email.  This year it also contains a collection of social networking and messaging tools.\r\n\r\nYou need to make sense of these new tools in order to stay competitive in today's world.  At the same time these new tools can ruin your effectiveness if they become a constant distraction and interruption.  We will talk about methods for controlling the level of connectedness that you need to be most effective.  In the modern world, it is essential that you control your level of access to others.  If not you will be buried in a sea of over-communication.\r\n\r\nA tool gives you leverage.  It multiplies your efforts.  Selecting and creating the right tools can make you many times more efficient than you would be without them.\r\n\r\nSo why don't people pay more attention to tools?  The answer is usually simple.  You are too busy doing the task today.  You don't have the time or the energy to invest in setting up a tool that will save you effort tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis can be a self-perpetuating reality.  We feel that were are running behind so we attempt to run harder until we drop from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to view every task as an opportunity to set up a better way.  When you approach your work with a mindset of improvement you see the many opportunities for improvement.\r\n\r\nPeople that build tools get more done.  Commit 20% of your time improving how you do things.  No matter what the specific details are in your job, there is opportunity for refining how you go about your work.  \r\n\r\nIf you aren't currently spending any time improving how you work then you should probably start by committing to 10%.  You will find that each improvement that you make lowers your stress and gives you more time to work on important tasks.\r\n\r\nBuild your own personal productivity platform! Some people are a lot more effective at getting things done because they employ a personal productivity platform. This gives them the technology for accomplishing and tracking things in real-time. You can set up your own, by giving some consideration to the following areas:\r\n\r\n* Task management - How do you track your upcoming appointments? How do you track all of the open projects with reminders about what needs to be done next?\r\n\r\n* Communication management - How do you stay in contact with people? How can you be more systematic and efficient about electronic communication?\r\n\r\n* Information management - How can you guarantee that your data will not be lost (either through an accident, or by not being able to find it in a timely way).\r\n\r\nWhen you have solid answers to each of these questions you have created an effective personal productivity platform.",

Many people can not readily identify the things that they value even though they are motivated by them each day.\r\n\r\nValues are at the core  of our lifestyle.  What we value says a lot about what we believe.  To a very large degree, they determine our behavior.   Therefore it is important to understand our true values.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that this can often be different than what we might tell someone else that we value.  Expressed values are about relationship, and the expectations of others.  You may have a different, and sometimes contradictory set of values that govern your daily actions.  \r\n\r\nIf these are not consistent with our expressed values then they are hidden because we are ashamed to tell others how we really feel.  This can lead to unhealthy attitudes and interactions with others.  It is much better to understand and express what you really hold dear to those close to you.  This integrity will, most likely, improve your relationships.\r\n\r\nValues provide the motivation that we need to deal with difficult situations.  They determine what we are willing to sacrifice for and what can be easily abandoned.  Both our finest and darkest moments are related to what we value.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand your own values since they are at the root of so much. Try the following exercise. Make a list of everything that you value.  If you are having difficulty then use Google to help by typing \"Values\" to get a list of possible values.  You should start with at least 30 items on your list.  \r\n\r\nPrune the list to get your top ten.  The top ten values would be things that you would consider changing your life for.  These are \"must haves\" not merely \"nice to haves\".  If you are having difficulty selecting the top ten then, ask which of two things you would rather have.\r\n\r\nFor example, asking \"Would I leave my job in order to be independent?\" will help you understand whether security, or independence are higher on your list.  Find hypothetical situations that shed light on your trade-offs.\r\n\r\nNow identify the top five and finally the top three.  This is a process of further honing a selecting.  As you went through the earlier list you may have encountered something in the list where you felt an emotional surge.  That is an indicator.  What would you lay your life down for?  What would you sacrifice your financial well-being for?\r\n\r\nThese top three values are the critical issues that will drive you to establish relationships, quit a job, or relocate to a new city.  Without these values you believe that your life is not worthwhile. Congratulations, you now understand yourself at a deeper level than 90% of people out there.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge will inform all of your other decisions.  It will give you insight to select opportunities as they arise and say \"no\" to things that don't make the cut.",

It will give you some valuable guidance in how to spend more time doing what you are well suited for.\r\n\r\nRemember a time when you were so engaged in what you were doing that you completely lost track of time.  You were consumed with your activity.  You were totally engrossed in the moment.  These golden moments reveal what you are passionate about.  What if you could spend twice the amount of time in this type of activity.\r\n\r\nLook for opportunities to do what you love.  Being passoionate about something is a great indicator of a strength.  Understand the specific situation that really lights your fire and look for similar activities that you can participate in.\r\n\r\nOther activities simplly drain the life right out of you.

We all have them, both good and bad.  Habits can be a powerful ally or a formiddable foe.  The good news is that we can shape our automatic responses. We can choose to change habits to ones that get us closer to our life goals.\r\n\r\nTake a moment and think of a habit that you would like to change.  This can be either a destructive habit that you desire to stop or a new good habit that you would like to begin. Changing a habit requires programming a new automatic response.  This typically takes about thrity repetitions of unbroken practice in order to stick.  During this time you focus you conscious attention on the new habit in hopes of programming an automatic\r\nresponse.  The bad news is that this takes a lot of effort and resolve.  The good news is that once the habit  has taken then you no longer need that conscious attention to continue.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to maintain motivation all alone.  Telling others about your desire to establish a new habit can often help.  Accountability can help you stay motivated by applying healthy peer pressure.  In addition to your own internal motivation for change you have the fear of embarrassment spurring you forward.\r\n\r\nThis is very important! Change one thing at a time.  It takes a lot of energy to establish a new habit.  Trying to be heroic and change several things at once will likely result in abandoning all of the desired behaviors before any of them become habits.  If you want to be aggressive then plan ahead to make one single change each month.  Fully master each new habit before moving to the next one.\r\n\r\nSmall life-long changes are much more useful than dramatic short-term changes.  Never commit to a change unless you believe that it could be sustained for the rest of your life.   Reduce your glorious goal to a subset that can be sustained.  Pick goals where your success is absolutely assured.  Then you can pick a more aggressive goal next month.  Success produces motivation, failure breeds despair.

According to the box each tool will work for any usage that you need.  Instead, find unbiased reviewers that compare how specific software packages will work for a given task.

If you become more clear about what your active projects you can greatly reduce your stress.  Understanding all of the activities that are in your life gives you a chance to prioritize them.\r\n\r\nSome of your projects are not really essential and, maybe even, not desirable.  By examining all of your projects, you can prioritize the important ones and reduce the effort expended on the rest.  This will let you put more energy into what really matters.\r\n\r\nEach project represents some desired goal. There is an outcome in mind or you wouldn't be doing it.   A project is a series of tasks that result in a goal.  They can be fully accomplished in a single action.  They often require actions over a period of time.  Therefore, you need to easily track all of your active projects.  \r\n\r\nMake a list of all of the things that are on your mind.  Writing them down give you confidence that you will not lose track of them.  Scan this list periodically to recall the things that you need to be working on. Write a single list so that you don't have to go to multiple locations to see the projects.  This encourages you to consult your list often.  Having multiple lists creates ambiguity.\r\n\r\nCreate another list of projects that you are not actively committed to spend time on.  This allows you to keep from forgetting totally about these other goals.  At the same time, it moves them out of the way.  You do not need to worry about all of these items as you do your active projects.  For most people there are about 20-30 active projects at any time.  There may be 50 more things that you would like to do someday, but these items should not take any of your daily attention.\r\n\r\nThe list of active projects should be updated every day.  As new projects are discovered then just add them to the list.  Pick a name that represents the goal of the project. Remove things from the project list when you no longer feel that the project needs your active attention.  This list is an effective tool only if it truly represents what you need to focus your attention on.\r\n",

I often have conversations with people where they tell me that they have too much work to do.  They are unable to do the things they value because there is a large bucket full of items needing attention.  This thinking is based on a faulty assumption.\r\nMany believe that emptying the bucket will produce a state of tranquility and peace.  The reality is that the bucket refills itself automatically.  Let's look at why this is the case.\r\nThe bucket represents our desire to accomplish certain goals.   We set our goals based on everything working in our favor.  In the perfect world, I plan to accomplish certain task over the next week.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world.  Two things are working against us. First, the expectations of others creep into our plans.  Additional unplanned tasks are added to our own desires and goals.  We originally set our plans to accomplish what we thought should be done.  Later we must adjust our plans to make room for new demands.\r\nSecond, our expectations are always optimistic. As we do a task we learn more about it.  Our expectation was based on full understanding, but we find that we only had a partial understanding initially.  Typical tasks may easily require three times the amount of time that we originally expected.  As we work on each task we get distracted and this causes further delays.\r\nSo what is the solution?  Do we create a firewall that prevents distractions and responding to the needs of others?  A far better solution is to adjust our own expectations.  We realize that work is a stream; it constantly replenishes itself.  As tasks are removed from the queue, new ones are added.  You never get done; you only make progress.\r\nOur focus should be on the results that we do achieve, rather than the items left in the stream.  Each task that we work on should be the most important and urgent task that we can work on at the time.  This way we have absolute confidence that the items left undone are less important.  It is far easier to control the present than worry about the future.",

For others planning is a boring activity that stifles creativity and wastes time.  When properly used planning can amplify your productivity by reducing rework.\r\n\r\nWhy plan at all? There are many risks that affect your project.  At its core planning is simply identifying likely risks and making decisions that mitigate their effect.\r\n\r\nIt is important to separate planning from convincing, although they may occur at the same time.  Convincing is selling your plan to others in a way that creates \"buy in\".  An excellent way to generate emotional buy-in for a plan is to involve others in its creation.  However, there are several aspects of planning itself that are important to understand before combining it with convincing others.\r\n\r\nRisk mitigation is the goal of every plan.  If nothing can derail your project then no plan is required.  You don't need a plan to wash the dishes; you just do it.  On the other hand, you can't build a software application without a plan.  There are too many unknowns that you must control.\r\n\r\nStart your planning by fast-forwarding to a bleak future, in which your project has failed.  What went wrong and how could you have prevented it?  At its core this is all planning is.\r\n\r\nWhat are the five greatest risks to your project? Forget about everything else.  If you don't address your top five issues then nothing else matters.  These may change over time.  More on that later.\r\n\r\nWhy five?  Humans are very good at storing a small number of items in short-term memory.  You want a short list of thing that can be readily remembered and communicated.\r\n\r\nThese top five risks should be written and posted somewhere that is readily visible.  Throughout the day you should observe this list at least once an hour.  It provides your emotional motivation for your actions.  \r\n\r\nWhy not three?  There are many different risks that affect you.  It is important for you to have some peripheral vision.  Risks that appear on the list may quickly become your top issue.  But rarely, do that appear out of nowhere.  \r\n\r\nYou may already be tracking the key issue and you know when it is changing in priority. You need to actively monitor and evaluate the relative priority of your top five issues.  Respond to new information as it become available.\r\n\r\nDecide what you will do about each of the top issues.  What action can you take that will significantly lower the risk?  Sometimes, a single action can have a big impact on a specific risk.  More often, there are several actions that are required to more the mountain.",

The system that he outlines is really a set of guiding principles.  He avoids locking the system into a specific implementation.\r\n\r\nAn entire cottage industry has risen up to provide software and ideas for implementing a Getting Things Done (GTD) system.  TO get a list of various software packages that you could use to setup your own system just type \"GTD software\" into Google.  You will get many different software solutions to fit every shape and size.\r\n\r\nCreate a simple system!    I've used a number of the software solutions for GTD. After spending several week setting the system up the way that I want it always seems to end at the same point. I can make the system do what I want but it requires a lot of mental energy to work the system. I need a system that requires almost no thought expect the tasks themselves. The system must be transparent and allow me to focus on the actual planning rather than the planning tool.\r\n\r\n    Here is the system that works for me. Use a text editor to create five text files. Set up a command or window short-cut that opens all five of the text files. A tabbed text editor works great for this. You can also open each of the files separately off of window short-cuts, but you must be able to open any of these files with a single click.\r\n\r\n    The five files that I use are:\r\n\r\n    * Calendar - List of events sorted by date\r\n\r\n    * Home - List of next actions that I plan to do today (typically around ten items)\r\n\r\n    * Work - List of next action that I plan for today (typically around ten items)\r\n\r\n    * Projects - List of things to work on this week (typically around 20-30 items grouped by categories)\r\n\r\n    * Someday - List of things that I would like to work on someday\r\n\r\n    All day long these files are updated. Resist the temptation to add structure to these. It is easy to get distracted by reorganizing the list. Sort the action lists with the most urgent items at the top.\r\n\r\n    I have been following the work of David Allen, the author of \"Getting Things Done\" for several years now. He has the most instructive system for managing your life. Here is a summary of how you can apply his ideas to build your own personal task management system.\r\n\r\n    Make a simple list of the next action that should be taken in each area where you need to accomplish something. Create another list of the projects that you are currently working on. In this context a project is any goal that requires more than one action to achieve. It is crucial to make the next actions very specific. They must be tasks that can be accomplished in less than an hour.\r\n\r\n    As you have time to work on your list, select a suitable task from your next action list. When completed you may have a new action to add to the list. As things pop up you can add them to your action list or the project list, if they require more than an hour.\r\n\r\n    Once a week make sure that you review the project list and that you have at least one next action for each of your active projects. All you need to build a minimal task management system is a pad of paper where you keep the two lists for your actions and projects.\r\n\r\n",

Think of a role as a long-term commitment that you made to pursue a set of goals.\r\n\r\nYou may have taken on the role of lover, father, employee, or accountant at your comic book store. Each of these roles comes with a set of goals and expectations.  Some of the expectations may be from others, but the important ones are those that you have for yourself.  Fulfilling a role means achieving these goals.\r\n\r\nWhen you take on a role you are committing to a plan of action.  For example, when you choose to role of lover, you decide that you want to make the associated trade-offs.  As an employee you get certain benefits and take on the goals of your employer.  Each role that we are in constrains our actions in exchange for the opportunities it gives.\r\n\r\nA role is a choice of some segment of lifestyle.  Some soles you choose willingly and others are thrust upon you.  Either way your role will determine your actions.\r\n\r\nEach role that you take on will have goals associated with it.  Understanding your roles will help you in planning, which will help you achieve goals and be more effective.\r\n\r\nTry this exercise.  It may seem trivial at first, but is harder than you think.  Select a role to work on.  Make a list of concrete goals that you have.  Don't select fuzzy goals like, 'Be a better person', but measurable goals like, 'Do dishes for a week'.\r\n\r\nIdentifying real steps you will take to fill that role is a huge step forward.  For each role you can probably identify ten projects.  A project is this context is simply a set of actions with a clear goal in mind.  This is what you can focus your effort on to be more effective in that role.  Fulfilling goals is how you fill roles.\r\n\r\nHow many roles do you have?  Look at what takes you time.  Most people have around ten roles.  In your work alone you probably have three to five roles.  Charting each of these out gives you a very clear picture of your like and your time commitments.\r\n\r\nI may seem overwhelming to you at first, that you have a hundred different project going.

There will be a few adjustments to make each time you go through it.

What benefit do you need from this project? What does complete success look like? What degree of partial success are you willing to live with?

Take the bigger goal and produce a series of smaller goals that represent real progress along the way. The effort required to achieve these milestones can be much easier to estimate than the entire goal. This greatly lowers the risk that you will not achieve the desired result.\r\n\r\nThe milestones within the tactical plan also give you a way to measure your progress.

Often, people need a chance to digest the information at one level before going deeper.\r\n\r\nTo help me organize thoughts around a subject that I want to teach I follow what I call a '4 x 4' process. This starts by identifying the top four most important areas of a topic.  Each of these areas is then broken down in another four topics.  If you are writing about a subject this allows you to describe the 21 (1+4+16) most important topics on any subject.\r\n\r\nThis process forces you to weed out a lot of material to focus on just the most important ideas and concepts.  This technique often gives you a great amount of clarity on a subject that you wish to master.\r\n\r\nThe is no better learning than teaching.  For you to teach someone else you must be very familiar with the subject.  The preparation for teaching is itself the best way for you to learn a new subject or master and old one.\r\n\r\nSeek to use simple terminology rather than technical jargon.  If you must rely on big words then you may just be repeating what you read, rather than truly grasping it.  Try to work with the ideas until you can explain it to someone that is smart, but ignorant on the subject.\r\n\r\nLearning requires passion, but so does teaching.  Follow the areas that you are most passionate about.  Seek out opportunities to share your knowledge with others.  Find other people that share your passion and enlighten each other more.   Most of all enjoy yourself.",

            "body": "People are nervous about trying a new operating system.  After many years of using the familiar environment most people become very comfortable with the way the system works.  Here are several reasons to consider trying Linux.\r\n1. It is easy and quick to try it.\r\n2. It makes software free.\r\n3. You try out many more programs than you would today.\r\n4. The operating system no longer is as important as it was.\r\n\r\nIt is quite easy to try a Linux system without making a commitment to it.  You get a Live CD for free from the \"Ubuntu.org\" web site.  Seriously... you just put in your address and they send you a disk.  \r\n\r\nOnce you have the CD you insert it into your computer and reboot it.  You have the choice of installing it or just running the operating system without installing anything on your hard disk.  If it is confusing and frustrating you just reboot and you are completely done.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to install Linux you will go through about 8 screens.  You can setup a computer to boot into Windows or Linux.  This is called dual-booting and is pretty easy to set up.  Caution: Always backup everything before you start installing an operating system.\r\n\r\nMost of the cost of running a computer is in the software, not the hardware.  If every software package that you install requires a license then you end up purchasing the same software more than once.  This applies both the operating system itself and the application software.  Before I switched to Linux it cost me about $1,000 each year to upgrade my computers.  Now, a new computer system costs around $500 for both the hardware and software.\r\n\r\nWith Linux you will try out more software than you are likely to do now.  The reason is simple; you don't have to commit to the software in order to try it.  Everything that you are likely to want is free.  The package installer makes it easy to set up a new program with a single line command.  \r\n\r\nYou can be up and running with a new application in less than one minute.  If you don't like the result then you uninstall the application and forget about it.  I try out at least one new application every week.  Many stick and many don't.  The applications are all very good at removing themselves without ruining your system.\r\n\r\nIn the past the operating system defined how you used your computer.  Selecting the operating system was a major choice.  There were only two real selections: Windows with 85% market share and Macintosh with 10%.  If you tied to use anything else you found a heap of heartache due to compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nThings are very different now.  Most applications that you care about are based on the web and whether you use Window, Mac, or Linux does not really matter. What does matter is how the operating system integrates with the internet.  Is is secure?  Are you going to get viruses? Do all of the media types that you need to exchange work properly?\r\n\r\nLinux is far superior to Windows in everything having to do with security.  The fundamental building blocks are much more reliable, stable, and robust. \r\n\r\n Consider what work you do with a computer and think about what it would be like to run faster and more secure with Linux.",

The true value of planning is not in the resulting plan, but the process of thinking through the issues.\r\n\r\nWhen you plan, try to create the simplest possible plan that will work.  This will be your most effective path forward.  If you are going to the grocery store the plan that will work will be a list of items to purchase.  On the other hand, if you are building a ship, the simplest plan that will work will be huge.\r\n\r\nEvery project has a fundamental complexity associated with it.  Your planning should match the complexity of the problem that you are trying to solve.  My experience shows that many large projects are over-planned, meaning that the plan for the project is much more complex than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nYour first job in planning is to figure out the appropriate scope of your project and match the scope of the plan to its complexity.  Start by considering previous projects that are similar.  What parts of the planning process worked for you?  What areas should be updated to match the new project?  Try to build on past experience rather than starting from scratch.",

Procrastination is typically a result of the indecision that results from the overwhelming number of choices for what to do.\r\nYou break this deadlock by decomposing a large project into a series of smaller projects.  This about your project as an outline of projects.  At each level completing the project is a matter of completing each of the projects underneath of it.\r\nThe project plan is nothing more than the mapping of the projects into sub-projects.  Two important questions emerge: How many sub-projects should be under each of the projects?  How deep should the planning process go?\r\nThe value of any list decreases with the length.  A flat list of the hundred things that you need to do has little value and will overwhelm you.   A good rule of thumb is to start with three things that must be done and allow it to grow as the problem dictates.  \r\nDon't use any more than seven projects under one project. Use nesting to capture the additional detail. This will also force you to balance the sub-projects relative to each other.  For example, when writing a book you would not plan it out as \"Think about title\", \"Write and publish all content\".  Pick sub-projects that are roughly equal is size and scope.\r\nThe depth that you do when planning is an important choice that you make.  Choose a depth that allows you to accurately see the scope of your project.  Use past experience to determine how to breakdown the first few levels.  The planning that you do now will set how you will track progress during the project.  But at this point in the project, you don't need to plan out all of the details.\r\nOnce you have created the initial task breakdown it is time to begin doing the work that you have outlined.  Start by taking the first lowest-level task in your outline. Estimate how long this will take.  If this task will take longer than a day then repeat the simple planning steps to decompose only this task into a smaller set of tasks (each of which require no more than one day to complete).\r\nThis planning method gives you lots of detail for things that are very close while retaining flexibility for future changes in the project.  It provides you with a very simple and robust plan for getting all the way from the start of the project to the end goals.",

This tracking is based upon the reality of actual performance rather than the desired outcome.  Therefore, it can not be corrupted by pressure to tell a different story.  \r\nThe best way to bring in a project that will be late is to reduce its scope or add more resources to the project. Both of these changes to the project plan must be done early enough in the project to affect the outcome. This planning method makes it clear that changing the plan late in a project only makes it later.\r\nDuring the project you can never back up and do it over.   All you can do is lay out the best possible plan from this point to the project completion.  You can never affect the past, but you must control the future.

If you need to coordinate between multiple people, departments, and companies, then the best way to do this is to identify key deliverables.

It is hard to inspire and motivate others if we can\u2019t even inspire ourselves. This can sometimes take some energy, but it is well worth the effort.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Maxwell wrote an excellent book on this subject, entitled \u201cToday Matters\u201d. In this book he describes the effects of the commitments that we make in a number of different areas. Each commitment that we make is established or undermined by our daily habits. Once the emotion that produced the commitment fades, we are left with these daily habits to carry us through.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve areas in which we make commitments that need to be serviced daily. These are what Maxwell calls the Daily Dozen. They include:\r\n\r\n* Attitude: Choose and display the right attitude.\r\n\r\n* Priority: Determine and act on important priorities.\r\n\r\n* Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines.\r\n\r\n* Family: Communicate and care for my family.\r\n\r\n* Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking.\r\n\r\n* Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments.\r\n\r\n* Finances: Make and properly manage money.\r\n\r\n* Faith: Deepen and live out my faith.\r\n\r\n* Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships.\r\n\r\n* Generosity: Plan for and model generosity.\r\n\r\n* Values: Embrace and practice good values.\r\n\r\n* Growth: Seek and experience improvements.\r\n\r\nSelf-leadership involves all of these unique aspects. As we seek to be better leaders, we should start with ourselves. To be able to motivate and influence others, we must first work on our own daily habits. Sometimes this is the most difficult step in leadership.\r\n\r\nTake a few minutes and score yourself against these personal commitments. How do you fare? Where would you like to grow?\r\n",

Most of us have a few minutes of planning time in the morning as we start our day.  Simply pause to ask the question, \u201cWhat did I do yesterday for my headline?\u201d  This will quickly bring you to the most important thing that you did of lasting value.\r\n\r\nThe logical extension of asking what you did, is to ask what you are planning to do today that will be remembered. This practice does not take much time, but it does create an opportunity for introspection and adjustment.  I would challenge you to try this simple exercise for two weeks to see what impact it has for you.  Write me and tell me your story.",

            "body": "Many people think of leaders as those with official leadership positions. While it is true that people with positions of authority are almost always leaders, it is also possible to demonstrate leadership without a title. Leadership is primarily about influence, and you can be a person of influence wherever you are.\r\n\r\nPeople in positions of authority have a special need to influence others. Trust is the most important ingredient in creating influence. Leaders who have not gained the trust of others will lack influence and will exhibit poor leadership. Remember, people will always follow someone they trust.\r\n\r\nTrust is earned over a period of time, and it is impossible to force someone to trust you. As a result, influence cannot be extracted merely by holding a position of authority. Therefore, leadership is something that a person grows into by making decisions that are beneficial to others.\r\n\r\nOnce others realize that you truly desire to help them, you will have influence in their lives. There is no shortcut to influence. You may be able to force obedience for a while, but you cannot force influence.\r\n\r\nAs we begin to understand that leadership is tied to influence we realize that anyone can lead. The true leaders in any group are the ones that people listen to and follow. This is not always the person at the top of the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nPositional authority is typically awarded to recognize increased leadership. The position recognizes, but does not create, leadership. In most cases, leadership is learned and earned.\r\n\r\nYou can begin acting today in a way that demonstrates to others that you care for their welfare. This will definitely result in an increase of your leadership ability.",

Otherwise, we would stay in bed all day and watch old TV reruns.\r\n\r\nBut this burning desire to produce value often leaves people feeling frustrated. They want to benefit others but don't seem to find the opportunities that they need to do so. This is where you, as a leader, can step in and help them. You can define ways for people to contribute to some purpose that is beyond themselves.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the process of defining opportunities for others will lead you on a personal journey of your own. By looking for ways to \u201cgive back\u201d to your community, you will become aware of opportunities that have been missing for years.\r\n\r\nThere is something extremely beneficial and fulfilling about trying to help others. It gives purpose and meaning to everything that we do. This is an area that represents a significant part of each of our lives. People that can not see beyond their own needs become increasingly in-grown and self-centered. It is also difficult for these people to have any sort of meaningful relationships.\r\n\r\nSome leaders are already committed to so many projects and causes that gathering more commitments would be harmful rather than beneficial. If you are one of these leaders, I encourage you to begin thinking about how you can get others excited about helping you. Instead of increasing your commitment level you can try to increase the commitment of others you know.\r\n\r\nCan you think of a project that you are involved in currently? Are there too few people to help and too much work to accomplish? Who do you know that could benefit from this opportunity to serve? Select people who are under-committed today. Don't choose the overworked rowers that are already in your boat.\r\n\r\nThink about this new opportunity from the perspective of the potential server. Is it a good opportunity for them? Do they bring strengths and passions that are well suited to the project? If so, then this is a project that could be very meaningful to them. Don't be apologetic about asking for their help. If you are trying to help yourself you probably should not ask. But if you truly believe this is an opportunity that will enhance their life then go for it.",

My parents were not always pleased when my curiosity drove me to take things apart to figure out how they worked. Over time though, this has developed into an adult-level understanding of invention and productivity. These natural tendencies are now coupled with experience and allow me to apply my energy to helping other people with technology.\r\n\r\nIn college I studied electrical engineering and graduated at the top of my class in 1981. After graduation I took a job with Hewlett-Packard and began designing disk drive controllers. My first project was a gigantic, 400 MB disk drive the size of a washing machine. During the course of my 25 years at HP I had the opportunity to design parts of many wonderful products, including: scanners, OCR software, web sites, printers, and digital cameras. One of the greatest joys for me is to walk into a store that carries consumer electronics and see all of the many products that I contributed to.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 I followed my dream and started a company, called Shrinking World Solutions. This company would serve the needs of businesses and non-profit organizations. Over the years I have had a lot of interactions with small business owners and non-profit leaders. Almost universally I see the same issues in play. Small organizations desperately need to utilize technology. However, it is bewildering to the leaders. How do we set it up? How do we keep it running? What if it doesn\u2019t do what was promised? These concerns are so daunting that most leaders try to ignore technical solutions until they have a crisis.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, we have seen a remarkable transformation in the high-tech industry. The internet has become the focal point for virtually all software. This allows people with nothing more than an internet connection to operate on a level playing field. Large companies with dedicated IT departments become very similar to a small business that relies on remote software to operate.\r\n\r\nThe world has truly become a small place. Small businesses can now sell products and services globally. The internet opens a new world of possibilities for businesses and organizations. Now it is no longer necessary to expend large amounts of capital to reach a global audience. This shrinking world phenomenon is at the doorstep of every small business and non-profit organization.\r\n\r\nShrinking World Solutions empowers you to reach the world, by offering low-cost technology and training on how to get the most from it. I believe in using low-cost tools that already exist, but also have the capability to produce new solutions when needed. Solutions don\u2019t have to be complicated to meet the challenge either; you just have to know how things really work first.\r\n\r\n",

This is a result of focusing on the few things that actually produce the best results for us.\r\n\r\nHe outlines specific tactics for how to eliminate the waste that takes over most of our days.  After we have pruned off all but the essential tasks then it is time to automate.

It also has a fairly high cost, so it cannot be undertaken lightly.  Consider how your learning experiences can be augmented with travel.\r\n\r\nThere is something amazing about going to somewhere that you have read about for years.  You are able to verify assumptions and interact with people that can tell first-hand stories about thier experiences.  Being is a place is so real and viceral compared to simply reading about something or watching the video.\r\n\r\nWhen you travel you have your own stories.  Things happen that are frustrating, exhilarating, and scary.  It is these times that cause you to grow personally.  These are not things that you seek out, but if you travel much you will get some travel stories to tell.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the obstacles that you encounter is actually one of the main benefits of travel.  After surviving several travel ordeals you learn to become adaptible.  This flexible is a great benefit to you in other situations that you are likely to encounter.\r\n\r\nAnother major benefit of travel is that you gain a greater awareness of culture.  By seeing someone else's culture first hand you learn to make observations about your own culture.  For example, after being in Europe, I am aware of how hurried Americans are when we eat.  If all I were ever to experience is fast food dining, then it would not be obvious how unusual that is.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to travel without confronting prejudice.  Both your own judgements about others and their judgements toward use surface when keep assumptions are challenged.  People that never travel can carefully protect their own illusions of reality, but these are dispelled when you come face-to-face with people that live in another reality.\r\n\r\nThe other major benefit of travel is that it is intellectually stimulating.  Anywhere you go is a change in context.  You are likely to get new ideas.  The farther you go the bigger the adventure.  You will see new places, eat new foods, hear new languages, experience new bathroom facilities, and meet new people.\r\n\r\nYou will love it and you will hate it.  But you will be truly alive.\r\n\r\nTraveling to other places breaks our daily habits and routines.  This can open our eyes to new people and places if we allow it.  We can become aware of new cultures and people that are not \"just like us\".  People that travel are typically much more open than those who do not.",

This will inevitably fail and potentially create an even worse situation.\r\n\r\nNothing preserves the status quo more than a failed attempt at change.  \"Oh, we tried that and look where it got us\", is the sure sign that that change was applied without understanding the real cause.  Don't pick the leaves, go for the roots.\r\n\r\nAfter identifying your primary pain it is time to explore causes.  The initial problem that you selected is probably too large.  You may need to drill down at least one level to find something that you can successfully change.\r\n\r\nEvery opportunity can be broken into smaller ones.  Identify areas that you wish to change and ask, \"Why is it this way currently?\"  Repeat this process until you reach a level where you think you can solve the problem.\r\n\r\n    Dig deeper!    It is vital to thoroughly understand why things are a certain way. To do this we can take our main problem and find reasons why it is that way. This will typically yield several different causes. For example, poor customer satisfaction can be caused by poor quality, missed deliveries, or bad support experiences.\r\n\r\n    One of these causes may dominate. If you hope to move the primary issue, invest in changing the issues that are most responsible for the cause. This get you one step closer to the root issue.\r\n\r\n    To get deeper is to repeat the practice of asking \"Why?\". Process experts recommend asking \"Why?\" five times before being satisfied that you have found the correct issue to fix. In other words, you may need to drill down on a problem five times in order to get to the root source that causes it.\r\n\r\n    If you are prepared to invest in analyzing a problem in this way your likelihood of solving greatly it increases. As an incentive think about the impact of truly solving a huge problem that you have been wrestling with. How much is this solution worth to your organization?

Delegation gives you the leverage to focus on your superpower while still accomplishing many tasks that are outside of it. Using others to complete activities that are not part of your core strengths lets you concentrate on your areas of brilliance. However, delegation can be tricky. It's not complex, but it may be hard to figure out how to make it work well.\r\n\r\nI recommend setting up delegation as three components: selecting tasks, setting expectations, and verifying the results. Every task worth delegating is worth setting up in this way. You should consciously think through each of these elements or just do the task yourself.\r\n\r\nNot every task should be delegated. They should be carefully selected using the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Does delegating this task save me significant time? If not don't delegate.\r\n\r\n2. Is the goal clear enough to communicate efficiently? If not then you may have to do so much communication and redirection that it loses the benefit you were hoping to achieve.\r\n\r\n3. Will you repeat this task many times? You get the biggest benefits from delegating tasks that can be taught once and repeated many times without having to do additional training. Think about the one-time setup costs and the setup costs associated with repeating the task.\r\n\r\nOnce you have selected the task it is time to set expectations. Start by deciding the objectives that you have for the task. What will the completed result be like? How long will it take? What are the keys for success? How much should it cost? How will you verify and incorporate the results?\r\n\r\nThese expectations must be written down and given to the person that is to carry out the task. Unspoken expectations are road to disappointment. Special care should be given to new tasks that you have not done before.\r\n\r\nBefore you can communicate expectations clearly, you should consider performing the tasks three times yourself. The first time allows you to decide what you are really looking for. The second time lets you write down a pattern that can be followed by another person about the steps that they should follow to achieve the desired results. The third time allows you to verify that the pattern actually works. This written pattern is the simplest form of training and will save you a lot of time in discussions with the person doing the work.\r\n\r\nThe third aspect of delegation is verifying that the results are acceptable and incorporating them into your organization. This involves acceptance testing and integration. If you have done a good job of setting the expectations then you already have a list of the acceptance criteria. This can be used as a check list to ensure that all of the desired elements are in place. The results of the delegated task do not produce a benefit until they have been combined with other task to produce the desired business result.

Any well-run organization has documented systems that define how things are done. Without taking the step of writing down these recipes, you must rely on the knowledge of the specific individuals that do the required jobs. What if that person is not a work? Do you want you business to stop?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to train a new employee on a system that is documented. This let's you cross-train more people and captures the critical aspects of doing a particular job. This information will provide a consistency in how tasks are done. No longer does each new repetition need to be a first time learning experience. Employees can learn the best practice from those that are doing the job best.\r\n\r\nOnce a process has been documented then you have defined a standard operating procedure. Now you can look at this to see if it can be improved. Once the four-minute mile became the new benchmark many runners began to look at this as the time to beat (not an impossible barrier). You can capture your current business practices and then try to develop and evolve them to something that continues to serve you better and better.\r\n\r\nIf you go to the trouble of developing system documentation how long should it be? I try to document everything critical about a system on a single page. Write the document but keep it short. Systems are naturally nested in each other so break a complicated system in subsystems, and further into more subsystems.\r\n\r\nAnyone can write a page of documentation to tell someone how something works.

With the explosion of the internet and the proliferation of discussion forums, blogs, webinars, and groups, it can be very confusing. There are probably groups out there that are discussing exactly what you need to know, but where do you start?\r\n\r\nI would recommend that you start reading one or two blogs (web logs) that are related to your interests.  Blogs are quickly becoming one of the main ways for content to be published on the internet.  There is a great tool for searching through blogs at http://technorati.com.\r\nTechnorati is your gateway to the world of blogging.  From here you will be able to search for content you care about throughout the \u201cblogosphere\u201d.  You will also be able to see the most popular blogs on the internet (by number of readers).\r\n\r\nOften, bloggers are tied into other forms of online community.  Once you find a blog you like, you can see other related web sites and online communities either in the overview for the blog or in the content itself.  If you are still looking for other connections to this content, then send email to the blogger and ask for advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople online can be extremely helpful.  There are certainly miscreants out there creating viruses and spam, but most people are eager to provide useful information.  The internet is a worldwide intellectual commons where someone able to navigate its highways and byways can easily access millions of other people.\r\n\r\nThe intent of Shrinking World Online (located at http://shrinking-world.org) is to give people a place to interact with others on the topics of Technology, Business, Leadership, and Community.  We believe that people working together can do so much more than they can individually.  A community is built around this goal of mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n    Learn from Others!   The internet is a phenomenal place to learn. There are so many interesting sources of information. Never before has so much data been so close to so many. Yet, at the same time, it can be hard to find things. It can also be hard to connect with others.\r\n\r\n    A community provides a social connection with other people that share your interests. It sets you on a path that will cause that interest to grow in a certain direction. For example, if you are interested in creating websites, joining a website design group will cause you to learn things that you did not specifically set out to learn.\r\n\r\n    The power of an online community is much like the benefit of belonging to a community \u201cin the real world\u201d. We share experiences, hopes, dreams and fears with one another. In doing so, we learn at a faster level and have a richer journey along the way.\r\n\r\n    If you are hoping to grow in some area, find an online community that will help you. The benefit of the internet is that your community can be composed of people all over the world. While you may have a hard time finding someone with your interest locally, there may be thousands elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    If your interest is Technology, Business, Leadership, or Community then you can find kindred spirits at http://shrinking-world.org. This is an online community dedicated to discussing those topics. We hope to see you there.\r\n\r\n",

For others, forming relationships is a big challenge. No matter which camp we find ourselves in, we need the input and insight that other people have to offer.\r\n\r\nIt can be easy for us to fool ourselves into thinking that we have a great idea, but once we air the idea in public we may find that it still needs more development. This is because other people are able to see ideas from a different perspective due to their background. Ideas are best developed and polished through the interactions of the different viewpoints that we each bring.\r\n\r\nEvery great idea can be made better by sharing it with others. All of us need to find a safe place to interact with others for the purpose of developing ideas and solving problems.\r\n\r\nMany people are reluctant to share their best ideas with others. They falsely believe that it is safer to keep their ideas to themselves.  It is true that you should be careful about how and when you share an idea.   However, an idea that is never shared is one that is never tested and probably will never be developed.  When an idea is shared it often turns into a new and more powerful idea.  So instead of losing the original idea a new one has been given birthorn.\r\n\r\nWhen we are trying to solve problems it is often useful to get the input of others.  We can all benefit by the experience of others.  Most problems we encounter have been confronted and solved by someone else.  It is good to have a community of people that can help us find solutions that we are looking for.  These are proven techniques that they have used and found to be effective.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of creating such a community online. It is based on the idea that people want to help each other succeed.  In future articles I will be providing more information about this online community and how you can become a part of it.",

Open Source software is created by teams of people working for free. Yes, you read right. People from different companies, nations, and professions willingly work together to create high-quality software. This software is then distributed and supported free of charge.\r\nI first came across Open Source software in the mid-eighties. Richard Stallman created an organization called the \u201cFree Software Foundation\u201d. This team published a manifesto that was based on the idea that software should be owned by everyone, and that it was immoral for companies to hoard this value to themselves. While Sallman was pretty extreme in his views, he created a movement that was to change the world.\r\n\r\nMuch of the explosive growth in the internet was caused by the availability of free software. Without it, innovation would be much more expensive and the higher development costs would make all software many times more expensive than what we see today. This would seriously curtail the new applications that anyone can use today.\r\n\r\nToday you can get high-quality tools in every possible category, including all of the most important office applications (including word processors, spreadsheets, presentations, databases, graphics editors, operating systems, and email). These applications are the lifeblood of any business. You cannot run a business without them, and the Open Source versions rival the commercial versions in every category.\r\n\r\nI have outfitted my business, Shrinking World Solutions, using Open Source software. To set up a new computer in our company we install a stack of about 20 applications. These are all free and give everyone in the company the exact same tools and configuration. This software configuration would cost around $5,000 per computer, but with cheap hardware, we can set up a new computer for $300 and two hours of time.",

This produces a feeling that there is a limited amount of resources that must be shared by everyone. If someone else gets a bigger piece of the pie, I will get a smaller one.  This attitude is based upon the assumption of fixed resources.\r\n\r\nWhat if the resources were not fixed but unlimited? How would that affect our perception? When we see the world through a lens of \u201cAbundance\u201d, we open ourselves to the opportunities that surround us. If we believe that the pie is of an adjustable size, then we begin to explore how we can make the pie bigger. If we are able to enlarge the pie, we all benefit.\r\n\r\nEvery business and organization competes in some way for customers, members, or awareness. This is often viewed as a competition for fixed resources: \u201cIf I get more someone else must get less.\u201d Many of these situations, however, allow us to find opportunities that allow everyone to come out better. This attitude of abundance allows us to pursue cooperation over competition.\r\n\r\nIs your organization really at odds with every other organization in the world, or are there ways that you share common goals and interests with others? Try to identify these common points of connection and find ways to establish alliances that let you both succeed. Two organizations that are aligned on a common goal can be much more effective than both of them working independently.\r\n\r\nA word of caution must be added to this message: the relationship will work well only if you are in agreement about the goal. If you do not have agreement on the desired outcome, the coordination may fail. You may find yourselves working at cross-purposes.\r\n\r\nYou must also be careful to allow time for the relationship to develop. Do not expect marriage on the first date. Select a project of mutual interest and see how that develops before making a larger commitment to each other.\r\n\r\nMy experience working with many organizations over the years is that not enough of them think about how to work with others. Most people are so consumed with their own challenges that they are blinded to some great opportunities around them.\r\n\r\nTake a few minutes and think about the best opportunity that you have to work with someone in another organization. What is the common goal? What would you get out of the deal? What would they get? Is it worth the effort?",

But 2009 was the year that I escaped from Microsoft. Everything about how Windows works is intended to lock users in for the long-term. It is promoted as the \"safe\" computing platform and the only reasonable choice for users.\r\n\r\nThis year finally demonstrated the coming sea change. Open source providers are challenging entrenched monopolies on their home turf. Companies that rely mostly on the inability of their customers to switch are doomed to occupy a niche.\r\n\r\nLinux is faster, more secure, and much lower maintenance cost than Windows.

Would you rather spend 50 hours instead?\r\n\r\nI still use Windows when I have to, but I complain intensely about its failings. When I use a computer, it is expected to serve me. When I use Windows I expect to spend a large fraction of my time serving it instead. The biggest reason to use Windows is that you are already using Windows. How long is this situation sustainable?

Recently I put together a simple computer system to use as a home server for $200.  This article will walk you through this process so that you can set up your own home server.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different options for how to configure the server.  The most important decision is the operating system that is run on the server.  My project goals are:\r\n\r\n   1. to provide easy setup - it must be up and running in a weekend\r\n   2. low cost - it should cost less than $500\r\n   3. low maintenance - it needs to run headless in a closet without me thinking about it\r\n\r\nThis last goal forced me to choose Linux.   Windows machines require almost daily maintenance.  With Linux I am able to write simple scripts that accomplish everything that I need to do with the server.  Once developed, the script will not change automatically behind my back.  This gives me full control of how the server works.  Windows machines are notorious for magically breaking themselves while you sleep.\r\n\r\nI started this project with a trip to Best Buy to find the cheapest computer that was fully assembled.  I found an Acer box the size of a Wii.  This tiny package sports a 1.6 GHz dual-core processor and 160GB disk for $200.  After cabling the computer it boots up into Windows XP.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to prepare a thumb drive so that it will install Linux.  To do this I use UNetBootin with the Ubuntu 8.04.  This gives me the latest version Linux with the Long-Term Support.  This is the best version to use with servers.  I originally tried to use the brand-new desktop version and ran into issues.\r\n\r\nTo install Linux from the thumb drive insert the thumb drive into a USB port and hit F12 while the computer boots.  This lets me boot off the live CD into Linux.  Next I get a choice about what I want to do.  It is a good idea to start by using the Live CD without installing to make sure that all of the drivers load properly.  Once you verify that these are all good you have confidence that the installed operating system will also work.\r\n\r\nDuring the install you are prompted to define how the disk will be used.  I recommend using the entire disk.  Forget the previous operating system and start fresh.  Otherwise you will be dragging a boat anchor.  This is clearly your easiest alternative.\r\n\r\nAnswer the remaining questions and let the process chug away.  It will be done about 15 minutes later.  You now have a working Linux machine for $200 and an hour of invested time.",

It is a constant distraction of clutter.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of any list is inversely proportional to its length.  A list of a hundred items is just noise that you have to ignore to do your work.  A small number of choices gives more efficiency to the task at hand.  The best rule-of-thumb is that each launcher icon should be a task that you are likely to require in the next hour.\r\n\r\nThe desktop is a great place to park items that are actively being worked on.  While switching from one task to the next, the items from the desktop should be stowed away. Items that are currently showing demand attention. Once they are dealt with they can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf your desktop is out of control then do this simple step.  Create a new folder on your desktop and drag all of your other icons into it.  When you need an icon you can simply open the folder and select it.  Any icon that you use more than three times in a day gets moved back to your desktop.  After a week remove the folder somewhere else slightly less convenient.  You will not end up placing more than five icons back on your desktop if you do this.\r\n\r\nFor the last few years I have maintained a clean desktop and recommend it to you.  It increases productivity and decreases the noise of mental clutter.  Try this simple improvement for one week and if it does not benefit you revert back to the current state.  It has not cost you any time.",

Linux lends itself to this type of quick start.  I still find that setting up Windows systems is extremely time intensive.\r\n\r\nFirst, Ubuntu is installed off of the Live CD.  This operation takes about 20 minutes with about 5 minutes of setup time and a break to watch a half-hour TV show.  When you return you are ready to customize the environment.   I have special commands that I am constantly updating.  Currently I have about 150 commands that automate everything that I do with the computer.   These commands are all stored in a directory called bin in my home directory.   They can be moved by network or thumb drive to any new system.\r\n\r\nNext I link my script to customize the shell from my home directory using:\r\nln ~/bin/bashrc ~/.bashrc\r\nNow you can make this active.\r\n. ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nThis process lets you get up and running in well less than an hour with a computer environment that has all of your favorite automation tools already configured.

Unfortunately, both of these operating systems have their own file system. This article will show you how to set up one set of documents that can be accessed from both operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe solution involves creating a tree of documents on the Windows system. I placed these in the default directory for Windows. On my system, the directory \u201cc:\\users\\Mark\\Documents\\\u201d holds the documents for the current user. So far, no special setup has been done.\r\n\r\nNow for the trick. Mount the entire Windows file system by editing the /etc/fstab. This file system table controls which drives are mounted when the Linux system is booted. On my system I added the line:\r\n\r\n/dev/sda1 /media/windows ntfs-3g nls=utf8,umask=077,uid=1000,gid=1000 01\r\n\r\nsda1 is read as storage device A and partition 1. Check for your actual storage devices by listing /dev. Create a directory for this file system to occupy at \u201c/media/windows\u201d. To make this change active run \u201csudo mount /media/windows\u201d. If this works you will have a bunch of files at /media/windows.\r\n\r\nNow for the second trick. Create a symbolic link from your home folder to your windows file tree. Use the following command to do this:\r\n\r\nln -s /media/windows/users/documents ~/docs\r\n\r\nNow the files in windows are readily accessible from your home directory at ~/docs. There is only one copy of each file so that you do not need to replicate anything. This is the perfect solution except for one issue the file system access through the Windows file system is much slower than accessing the files directly in the Linux file system. Otherwise I would consider doing the entire Linux system this way. However, this solution works extremely well for collections of documents that are regularly edited in both operating environments.",

That gave me a unique opportunity to compare the features and the upgrade process of the two leading operating systems for the desktop. In both situation I had a previously installed version of the predecessor operating system installed on my hard disk.\r\n\r\nThe day began by tackling the Windows 7 install, which is touted as a \u201cSimpler PC from day one\u201d. I dual boot my machine into Windows or Linux. The Windows partition occupies 80 GB of space while the Linux partition uses 25 GB.\r\n\r\nThe Windows partition needs at least 12 GB free to attempt the install, so it took me three attempts to get the system to be content with the amount of space. By this point I had invested about three hours in the upgrade process.\r\n\r\nOnce I had enough space the install wizard automatically upgrades all of the files from my Windows Vista installation. This process took another 3 hours. After six hours I had a clean boot.\r\n\r\nWindows 7 looks very attractive and also preserved my settings. I was able to run applications like Visual Studio without making any further adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe one unfortunate consequence of the Windows 7 install, is that it overwrote the boot partition. In order to fix this I decided to install the previous version of Linux on top of the existing partition. It was interesting to see that although it replaced all of the system files, it left my data files in place. The net result was to allow me to restore the operating system without destroying my data. I fully expected to have to recover my data from backups.\r\n\r\nOnce the Linux system was brought back to life, I had a system that would boot into either Windows 7 or Ubuntu 9.04. Next I was ready to tackle the Ubuntu upgrade, which was just released today. I was surprised to find that the Update Manager had a button to allow me to upgrade between major releases of the software.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft goes to great lengths to make sure that nobody steals Windows. This has a lot of negative consequences if you are trying to set up your system. I was told at the store where I bought Windows that if the shrink-wrap was removed that it would constitute being opened. That made me pause to consider whether I was really committed enough to get it to work, to account for the risk.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to make it hard to upgrade, the Linux creators where inviting me to click a button that would go get all of the files that had changed for the new release. Unfortunately, this is so inviting that I was probably one of a million people to attempt this activity on the day of the release. It determined that 1200 files were needed. The download is going very slowly but I am hoping that the invested time will be minimized.\r\n\r\nOverall I am much more pleased with the way that Linux is upgraded and maintained than the heavy handed approach that Microsoft uses. Both operating systems have great functionality, but take much more effort to keep my Microsoft Windows machines running.",

Many people that became early adopters of the web are still locked into that mindset. Fortunately, the tools have improved considerably.\r\n\r\nToday web sites are created so that you can update the content yourself. While it still may take somewhat of a genius to set it up, everyone can update the text within the structure of the site. In the middle of this decade we saw a number of tools released that allow you to maintain your own content. If you still rely on a web developer to add an upcoming event to your web site, then it is time for a change. A web site with obsolete material is a dead web site that no one will visit more than once.\r\n\r\nMy favorite tools for maintaining your own content are based on what you are trying to achieve with your site. For a blog, I believe the best tool is Word Press. For a basic web site that can act as a general technology platform, use Joomla. And for displaying photo galleries, check out Copper Mine Gallery. These three great tools can be used to offer state-of-the-art capability without requiring any programming.\r\n\r\nEach of them have an administrator view that allows you to configure the options that you want. You may consider hiring a web developer that is familiar with these tools, if you want to save the time required to learn about them. The cost of hiring someone to set up these will be signicantly cheaper than the cost to build a traditional web site.

Many fewer have a web site that is used to coordinate the work that happens within the organization. A Biz Portal is exactly that. It gives you an easy way to exchange information within the boundaries of the organization. It provides a focal point for all of the events, projects, news, and tools that each member might need to be successful.\r\n\r\nA simple Biz Portal is easy to create, can be set up quickly, and enhanced as the needs grow. Your web site should offer the follow capabilities to your organization.\r\n\r\n   1. Provide news for everyone to see\r\n   2. Create a shared calendar where each person can post events\r\n   3. Allow protected access from anywhere (with user passwords)\r\n   4. Document repository for all of the instruction showing how to accomplish all tasks\r\n   5. Project profiles and business plans (set up with controlled access for users)\r\n   6. Task management tools to coordinate who does what\r\n   7. Client information to provide access to key information\r\n\r\nI recommend that a portal be implemented as a multi-page web site with the following main pages: Company, Marketing, Operations, Finance, and Clients. Within each of these pages are sections that can be selected with a secondary menu. These menus offer topics that are specific to each of the pages.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good idea to provide specific permissions for each individual that will use the site so that the correct information can be exposed. You may want to control who can see or edit what content. You will certainly want to limit all access to registered users. A system like this can typically be set up for a few hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nIf your organization's portal already does this, then breathe easy.

At each of these locations you may have edited some of the files. Suddenly, you realize that you are not sure where the most recent copy is kept. If this sounds familiar the SyncBack is your friend.\r\n\r\nYou can get SyncBack free from http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html. This amazing application helps you solve the problem encountered with file replication. It is easy to set up and has many features that you can grow into over time. This article will cover the most basic use model.\r\n\r\nYou will most likely want to use SyncBack initially to synchronize files between two directories. To do this you create a profile and select the synchronize option. Then you specify the source and destination directories. When you run this profile the newer files that occur in one of the directories will be duplicated in the other. Files missing in either directory will be created in the other.\r\n\r\nHere are four distinct ways that you can benefit from using SyncBack today.\r\n\r\n   1. Thumb drive - Put files on a thumb drive and take them with you. Use synchronize to copy new files to your thumb drive, but also update your computer copies with edits that you made while you were away.\r\n   2. Another hard disk - If you have a second hard disk you can synchronize directories between the two disks. This gives you a secondary copy if your computer crashes.\r\n   3. Newtwork disk - If you have a LAN then it is easy to share a group of files between multiple users. Just set up the directories that you would like to replicate and everybody gets the updated files.\r\n   4. FTP account - You can set up a directory to be synchronized to an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) account. No more fumbling with an FTP client application and figuring out which files to update.\r\n\r\nEach of these use models produces real value for you. Pick the ones that you need and implement them today. You will want to adjust some of the options to more closely fit your specific needs.

            "body": "It is hard to pass up a bargain, especially when something is supposedly free. But in order to figure the real cost of something you must look at all of the factors. I often see people developing a web site in what appears to be a very low cost way, only to find out that the actual cost was many times what they thought. There are a lot of hidden cost in using technology. You must accurately figure these cost in or you will make some serious mistakes.\r\n\r\nThere are essentially three costs to developing a web site. These are the costs of learning new skills that you do not currently have, time spent doing the work, and dollars spent on professional services or tools. The latter is the cost that is obvious to most people. You know when you are about to purchase web site hosting or a web development tool, but the other costs might not be so obvious to you.\r\n\r\nMost people believe that the time that it will take them to do the job is the time that it would take a fully trained professional. The reasoning is, \u201cthey are smart, but so am I\u201d. If you read advertisements for tools, you see claims that you can achieve certain results in minutes. This may only be true after you have spent many hours learning the knowledge that you are missing.\r\n\r\nIt is true that any smart person can learn what is required to build a web site. The dirty little secret is that you may need to invest between 100 to 200 hours of your precious time discovering what you need to know. If you plan on building a number of different web sites then this is time well spent. Or if you feel that this is a hobby, you might gladly pay for the priviledge of learning. On the other hand, if this is just a job that you want done, it is difficult to justify the tremendous expense invovled.\r\n\r\nMany people would not (and should not) embark on a project like this if they knew the actual costs. Unfortunately, the real costs become apparent only after you have invested the time. It is a little like buying an airplane only to find out that it will require another large investment to learn to fly it.\r\n\r\nHere's the rule of thumb that I use when approaching new technology. I count the number of new tricks that need to be learned. This includes using a new editor, setting up the hosting environment, figuring out what a control panel is for, or configuring a blog. Anything that I do not have specific experience with goes on the list. Then multiply this number of items by four hours. You can learn a couple of new tricks in a day, but I'd bet money that you can't beat that on average.\r\n\r\nAnother assumption to make is that anything you have not seen running does not work. People assume that the technology should work. In reality, technology only works when you force it to. I've been building systems for 27 years and they only work because they are designed to.\r\n\r\nAll of these factors will help you get to the true cost of your web site project. What you don't know can truly hurt you, so it's best to do a careful assessment at the beginning of a project.",

The heart of this computer strategy is the software used to run all of the functionality related to the office. The required functionality includes an email reader, word processing, presentations, and spreadsheets.\r\n\r\nFor many years I have used to Microsoft Office Suite to get all of this functionality with a single package. As I began to look at the cost of setting up this software on every computer in the company I realized that this could be quite expensive. I began to seriously consider the Open Office suite, for the first time.\r\n\r\nOpen Office is an Open Source alternative to Microsoft Office. It can be installed on your local computer free of charge. It is similar in many respects to the Microsoft software, but does it create compatibility problems. Over the years I have watched as coworkers have struggled to use tools that were different than what everyone else is using. My conclusion is that it is best to use mainstream software rather than cutting edge solutions.\r\n\r\nI cautiously began to evaluate, and finally adopt, Open Office as a standard tool. It reads the Microsoft file formats and offers very similar functionality. It is easy to use and well-designed. The major disadvantage that it has is that it is different. There is always some amount of pain switching from one software application to another. I experienced a similar discomfort switching to the newer version of Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nMy general recommendation is that Open Office provides a mainstream alternative to Microsoft Office. This is a great fit for a small company or organization that wishes to control costs. You can satisfy your business needs without spending any money per computer to do it.

            "body": "One of the best tools for an organization to use is an email auto-responder. An auto-responder is a tool that automatically generates email messages based on certain conditions that you specify. The auto-responder is one of the most underutilized tools available.\r\n\r\nThis is the tool that evil people use to generate spam that clogs up all of our email in-boxes. The problem of spam (unsolicited email) lies not with the tool but the people using it. Organizations that use an auto-responder properly will be able to greatly improve their communication.\r\n\r\nFirst we will look at how an auto-responder works and then at how you can best use this tool. To program your auto-responder, you set up a sequence of messages that you would like subscribers to receive, configure them to be delivered at predetermined intervals, and then add a subscription form to your web site.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that people subscribe themselves to your list. This is also called an \u201copt-in\u201d list. It is one thing to send email that people request; it is entirely different to send people junk that they do not want. It is also important to provide a simple way to unsubscribe with every message.\r\n\r\nWhat makes an auto-responder so powerful is that it moves you from a haphazard communication method to a systematic one. Once you have begun to use this tool, you will realize the convenience of designing a message stream to communicate with new subscribers. Most organizational communication is not thoughtfully crafted. Instead, it is offered as an off-the-cuff response to a query that someone made.\r\n\r\nThe best way to communicate with a group is to figure out what essential message needs to be communicated and how that message should be sent. Once your messages have been written they are put into the auto-responder and people are invited to subscribe to receive the valuable content that you offer.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of this method of communication is that if your message is not interesting people will unsubscribe. This provides an incentive for you to supply people with information that is practical and valuable to them. In the end, this may well be the biggest advantage of using an auto-responder. It inspires you to tell a more interesting story.",

Why would we ever do work that isn't really needed? And yet I am amazed at how often I find myself doing tasks for a number of other reasons. One way to break this cycle of ineffective activity is to only perform tasks that have an immediate customer. The person that benefits could be an external client or an internal client (even yourself) that needs you to create something.\r\n\r\n    If you only do the minimal work needed to satisfy the \u201ccustomer\u201d then you will eliminate any gratuitous activities that don't contribute directly to the result. Manufacturing organizations have functioned like this for years. Toyota is an excellent example. On their manufacturing lines they only build a car to satisfy a specific order. Then they only install a dashboard to contribute, which in term generates a request for a speedometer assembly, which creates an order for the required parts.\r\n\r\n    It is wasteful to work on tasks that produce results only to find that there is not a clear way to use those results because of other missing pieces in the system. This is where we get the concept of work flow. If you are in the business of publishing any kind of material, then all of the tasks that you perform should be directly supporting the publication that is required. It is important to start with the end in mind and work backwards.\r\n\r\n    If the result is clear, then it will be easy to figure out the easiest way to achieve it. What is the minimum set of subtasks that will achieve the desired result? Then what are the subtasks to required to produce those results? This is a more effective way to plan a project to avoid assembling activities that may or may not contribute directly to the end goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to reduce every solution to its essence.  Inventing something scrutinize it thoroughly to see if half of the remaining parts can be removed.  During the invention process don't worry about the complexity too much. But do not forget this important step before accepting the final solution.\r\n\r\nComplexity is the enemy.  If people have to remember to perform a complicated set of steps then it will never happen.   Software automation that requires thousands of lines of code requires a phenomenal investment to keep running.  The best software to debug is one command that does exactly what you want.  The best manual task is the one that requires zero steps for humans to perform.",

            "body": "Every organization needs to grow and improve. To stop growing means beginning to die. Growth can come in many different forms, but a commitment to learning and improving is absolutely essential. Every business or non-profit organization exists to produce some kind of value for its members, customers, share holders, or those it serves. Growth means producing increasing levels of value over time.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, you must establish practices that are both effective and efficient. Effectiveness is doing the right things so that the desired benefits are actually realized. Efficiency is doing things right to minimize the cost. It is possible for an organization to achieve one of these objectives without the other, but both are necessary to produce the results at a reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nIn order to constantly improve effectiveness and efficiency an organization must commit to a pattern of constant innovation. It needs to examine what it is doing and how it is doing it. This examination uncovers gaps between what actually is and what should be. Innovation happens when we close this gap.\r\n\r\nThe first step in creating a cycle of constant innovation is to make a commitment to seeing it through.  Choosing to embark on a journey of continuous improvement means that you will be learning what is needed to take your organization to the next level.\r\n\r\nWe will be looking at the pieces of the innovation cycle:  Learn, Plan, Invent, and Teach.  This integrated approach will be applied incrementally and continuously to produce the results you need.\r\n\r\nIn the next few articles I will show you how to create a constant innovation cycle that will allow your organization to continuously grow.

If you are missing one of these technologies you will find yourself at a competitive disadvantage. This will continue as long as you try to use an incomplete tool set.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a web site yet, this article will give you the information you need to set one up. Fortunately, a great web site can be created and hosted for you with little time or money.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about why your organization needs a web site. A web site is an online equivalent to a store front and a yellow pages listing combined. It is the online face of your organization.\r\n\r\nAny potential customer or member of your organization will likely visit your web site to understand simple things about your business, such as where you are located and what you are selling. If you are a non-profit group, they will want to know where and when the group meets. They will also expect to see upcoming events and affiliations with other organizations.\r\n\r\nA business or organization without a web site may be viewed in the same light as someone doing business out of the back of their van. It may be a completely legitimate organization but the lack of a decent web site undermines credibility.\r\n\r\nIt is also best, although not absolutely critical, to have your own domain name. You can register a domain name like \"MyBusiness.com\" for your web site. This will allow people to find you by typing in \"MyBusiness.com\" into the address field of their browser. The domain name will make your web site look more professional and bring additional credibility to your organization.\r\n\r\nNow that you understand why a web site is important, the next article will show you how to set one up quickly and easily.",

            "body": "People often ask about the easiest way to create a web site.  The answer is simple:  Let someone else create it for you.  There are a number of different paths to getting an initial web site created.  The resulting websites are very low cost, professional looking, and can be created quickly.  This article details several options for creating a website without any heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nThe specific tools available to you will depend on the web hosting provider that you select.  Each hosting company will provide either services to build your web site for you or software that can be installed in your hosting account so that you can build the web site for yourself.  If you use a design service to build your site, you will describe the result that you want and they will produce it for you.  This can sometimes produce a dilemma for how to handle the ongoing maintenance of the site.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative is to install software in your hosting account that has a series of forms to allow you to construct simple web pages, step by step. This method allows you to create a web site by selecting from a series of simple choices.  This is a good way to work if you are unsure about the end result when you start.  The biggest issue with these tools is that you have to know how to create a good web site; they don\u2019t provide the professional advice necessary to create your site.\r\n\r\nA third alternative is to find a web hosting provider that creates \u201cmanaged websites\u201d.  This means that the hosting provider creates the web site, and does ongoing maintenance throughout the life of the site.  With a managed website, you control all of the content on the site.  To get changes made to the site structure you just notify the customer care representative and the changes are made for you.  To update the content on your site you just login and add, modify, or delete articles that appear on your site.\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage of this approach over the web design tools is that you do not have to learn about what it takes to create a professional web site. You do not need to learn anything about computer programming or web design; the hosting provider will take care of that for you. Your hosting provider gives you what you need so that you can focus on creating the content that you want to communicate through your site.\r\n\r\nOur company, Shrinking World Solutions, provides managed web hosting at prices starting at $60 for a year of service.  The membership price includes all services for creation, hosting, maintenance and support.  This is a great way to get a website running quickly, while allowing for later growth.",

These do not hide;they are in your face each an every day.  This works in our favor if we let it.  We do not have to search to know where the next big improvement needs to happen. It finds us.\r\n\r\nTake a minute now to identify the next area that needs work in your life (or the next area of work that needs life).  Phrase the desired outcome that you would like in less than five words.  Examples: \"Improve satisfaction scores\", \"Eliminate unproductive meetings\", \"TPS reports on-time\".\r\n\r\nThis is an important step in solving the problem. Naming a particular issue give us a certain resolve to improve it.  Think of this as creating an internal commitment to make a difference in the way things work.  This is the first step in making an objective.\r\n\r\nMeasure the pain in the amount of needless money, time, and stress that is wasted. Attempt to quantify these, so that you can measure any improvements that you make. Your change should bring relief in the area of the greatest pain.  This is also your greatest opportunity.\r\n\r\nAs you make changes evaluate the impact.  Does the change reduce the pain?   Does it have unexpected side effects?   An honest assessment is essential to achieving the desired results. The actual results of the change should be compared to the expected results.  Did you get the impact that you hoped for?   Or is something blocking the desired result?  Is this problem still worth working on or is there a better opportunity for improvement elsewhere?\r\n\r\nThe insights that come from this type of evaluation are very useful.

This is the number one reason why websites fail.\r\n\r\nAn organization knows that they need a website, so they find a web developer to build them a beautiful site.  At the end of the project the site begins aging.  The organization is understandably excited to invite users to their site.  However, on returning a second time, the users find that there is no new information.  They will never return to your site when there are so many others that offer a stream of fresh information updated continuously.\r\n\r\nThe cure for this disastrous problem is to create a website that is easy for you to update.  With modern tools it can be as easy to update your website as it is to type a document on your computer.  When you see some text that you would like to add or modify, you login and press an edit button.  This gives you an editor that you can cut and paste text into.  The results that you save are instantly viewable from anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nA web site that is easy to change is modified constantly.  Think about a grocery list posted on your refrigerator. Your web site should be that easy for you to change.  If you get a new idea, capture it.  If you have a different way to say something to your users, then correct it before you forget.\r\n\r\nThese systems that allow you to change the content are often called Content Management Systems (or CMS).  They separate the site structure from the site content. The structure becomes stable very quickly, but the content is updated frequently.  Modifying content is done by publishing articles on the site.\r\n\r\nMy favorite CMS tool is Joomla. The sites are robust, flexible, easy to maintain, and quick to set up.  Shrinking World Solutions provides services to set up, host the site, and maintain it for the long-term.  This lets you concentrate on publishing the material that your readers want.",

The best system for gathering knowledge provide an easy way to contribute to the work by editing the content that someone else wrote. This creates a group ownership of the end result. Editing content is just as important as authoring the original. This should be recognized by the reward system. This process encourages a healthy interaction between the participants.

For some people the perfect day is one spent doing contract negotiation, or fly fishing, or jumping out of airplanes.

These are either tasks that consume a large chunk of your time, ones that you do many times throughout the day, or tasks that will cause you great remorse if neglected.\r\nThese task (taken together) are your essential tasks.  How you deal with these will largely determine your personal effectiveness.  It may help to highlight a few essential tasks in each of the three categories.\r\nI am a consultant so each month invoices must be created.  This is not a complicated task but it can be time-consuming.  Because this is recurring and costly it is an essential task for me.  Instead of spending time just creating the invoice I try to invest the same amount of time improving the way that I create an invoice.\r\nIf it takes me a thirty minutes to create an invoice then it would be better to invest thirty minutes today to let me create an invoice next time in fifteen minutes.  \r\nThe rule of thumb is that if you have a recurring job that takes X to do then invest X in trying to get the job to cost X/2.  On your second time you will break even.  In our example, it took 60 minutes (30+30) to create three invoices the old way, and now it takes 60 minutes (30+15+15).  If you do 24 invoices a year you save 5 1/2 hours (15m*24-30m). \r\nYou save the most by improving the tasks that take the largest percentage of your time.  In our invoicing example we were dealing with a task that takes 12 hours in a year.  Consider a task that consumes 40% of your work time.  Now you're talking about a whopping 800 hours every year.   If you could find a way to improve this essential task by 50% then you could save 400 hours every year. \r\nI recommend that you use this type of a simple calculation with your most essential tasks.  These are the ones that when gathered represent the bulk of your time investment.  In the previous example if you could get a gain of 400 hours in a year then it would be worth investing up to 400 hours to achieve it.  Remember that time invested in improving continues to pay you back.",

When displaying a page of topics the text from the topics one level down is also displayed. This allows you to read while getting a slightly more complete context without clicking to go deeper. This sneak-peek feature is one of the innovations in usability unique to MyBook.\r\n\r\nAn index will get you to each of the topics in the book quickly. The index page shows you all of the topics of the first three levels of the book. This lets you scan the entire book looking for interesting topics. It encourages you to skim rather than read the whole book. People are busy and they are looking for value quickly. In this internet age we are all looking for instant gratification.\r\n\r\nEach page of the site has links to help you get back to where you came from. Click on any of these link to go up in the topic list. This gives you an extremely fast way to jump through the topics of interests. It lets your readers catch the ideas that they are interested in without having to wade through the rest. \r\n",

Any of these technologies may be replaced by another that provides improved characteristics. This chapter outline the current technology stack that is used today.\r\n\r\nDjango\r\nThe most important technology decision for MyBook is the selection of the Django web application framework. Django is perfect for these types of applications. It is easy to write shell scripts that write the custom code for the application.\r\n\r\nDjango is very flexible in allowing custom code where it is needed while eliminating any repeated code structures that are common within web applications. In other words it is easy to write a simple program that does nothing and then grow it into a powerful application by incrementally adding features.\r\n\r\nPython\r\nThe Django application framework is written mostly in the Python programming language. Python is a very concise and powerful language. Programmers familiar with Python are much more productive than programmers using other languages. There is excellent support for both high and low-level language features.\r\n\r\nPython also enjoys some of the fastest execution times for scripting languages. It is extremely portable and can run across many computer architectures and operating systems.\r\n\r\nMySql\r\nThe MyBook application saves its data in a MySQL database. MySQL is an open-sourced implementation of the Structured Query Language (SQL) that drives most databases in use today. It is available free of charge. It is free to use in any way that you see fit.\r\n\r\nOverall it is the leading choice of developers looking for an alternative to the proprietary solutions provided by large vendors. This issue of vendor lock-in can be a significant millstone around the neck of any project.",

Many projects are only useful when they have been fully completed. MyBook is organized and driven by having an initial core functionality that is improved over time.\r\n\r\nEach step of the evolution will only make it better. This also means that the application itself is constantly under construction. New features are not added to the application until they work correctly.\r\n\r\nThis gives you a stable and reliable platform that you can use that will continue to get better over time.\r\n",

Plans that require twenty hours of painful deliberation will always far outlive their usefulness.  It must be easy for you to make minor adjustments as you learn new information.\r\n\r\nIf your plan can be adjusted in five minutes then you will not hesitate to do so whenever it is needed.  The most crucial planning involves identifying the top five risks and the best action to lower the risk.  Therefore a minimalistic plan is just a list of those risks and the actions that will address them.\r\n\r\nAdjusting this plan can certainly be done in five minutes.  You can write this on a list in your pocket and review it as you wait in line. This is portable, flexibile, and yet robust enough to encourage disciplined thinking.\r\n\r\nAs things change you can easily switch priorities on your top five risks.  It is equally easy to decide on a different action for one of the risks.  As new risks are discovered you can integrate them onto your list.  Remember to prioritize the list to actively track your top five.  Otherwise you will end up with a list of twenty things which is the same as having no priority at all.\r\n\r\nHow often should the plan be update?  Whenever you have new information or new ideas then update your plan.  Each time you are ready to make a different decision then update your plan and think about all of the implications involved.\r\n\r\nConsider these changes as adjustments, rather than create a new plan.  You are refining your thinking based on your best knowledge at the time.  Don't lock yourself into old ideas that no longer are optimal.  The changes are minor tweaks in a consistent overall direction.\r\n\r\nBy making small but constant changes you are always ready to respond to the next change in your project.  No longer are you locked in to obsolete plans that have no chance of success.  Instead you have a consistent path forward with an infinite variety of possible paths.",

You need a plan for learning and a system that allows you to track your progress.  By following a few simple practices you can put your learning into overdrive.\r\n\r\nA learning system should be goal oriented.  At its core you should have tools for setting and tracking learning goals.  There are several different time horizons that you will want to work with.  You should be activity thinking about what you wish to learn in the next year, the next month, and the next week.\r\n\r\nYour system should be simple.  Start with a simple text file.  Any more complicated tool tempts you to focus on the format of the information rather than the information itself.  I speak from experience here, having used many different tools like mind-mapping, outliners, word processors and goal setting tools.\r\n\r\nShort is better than long. One page is more than enough to capture any set of goals that you have.  A small amount of planning is productive, but more planning is not.  Your plan should be just comprehensive enough to give you confidence that you are working on the right things.  Any more than that is a waste.\r\n\r\nStart with your short term.  What are you learning this week?  Make a list of the things that you are actively learning.  Now group these into goals for the next month.  Are there other things that you need to learn this month that are not on this list?\r\n\r\nNow focus on the long term.  What  would you like to be learning over the next year?  As you do this level make sure to reconcile what you are doing now with where you would like to be in a year.  When you are done you will have a complete map of where you want to be in a year and how your daily activities can contribute to that.\r\n\r\nThe first time that you go through this process you could easily spend an hour or two.  Once you have your initial plan it should take no more than five minutes to review the plan and make any minor corrections due to what has changed.  You should review this plan at least once a week.\r\n\r\nThere you have it: a simple but robust system to manage your learning, that takes one piece of paper and five minutes per week.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "When it comes to changing habits, small consistent changes are far better than large ones.  The reason is simple.  A large change is almost always temporary while a small one is sustainable.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to change everything thing at once, consider embracing an attitude of sustainable change.  Adopt a mindset of analysis and constantly apply minor improvements.  Apply changes one at a time.\r\n\r\nAny change that you apply should be sustainable for the rest of your life.  Consider carefully one minor tweak and then fully adopt it into your life before you choose the next one.  Build incrementally on what is already effective in your life.\r\n\r\nYou will need to develop four essential competencies. These are the abilities to Learn, Plan, Invent, and Teach. In this series of articles you will learn to apply these capabilities to build a system of constant innovation for your organization.\r\n\r\nThe whole process of innovation begins with Learning. This includes the ability to analyze the problem, understand all the key constraints, and identify possible solutions. In future articles we will explore each of these key aspects in detail. For now, think about a problem area that you need to improve. Jot down a few ideas related to these three aspects: Analysis, Constraints, and Solutions.\r\n\r\nNow we are ready to proceed to the Planning stage. The three phases of planning are: establish objectives, prioritize the possible solutions, and breakdown the specific tasks for the projects that you intend to implement. The objectives you set will help you to do the cost-benefit analysis that is needed to prioritize between alternatives. The tactical planning is usually the simplest planning step.\r\n\r\nThe Inventing stage is when you apply the solution you created and measure the results. It is critical to set up the change as a controlled experiment to confirm what you thought would happen. These changes should always be applied incrementally to guarantee that you are producing the desired result from your change. Implement only one change at a time, and reject changes that do not produce the benefit that you expected.\r\n\r\nTeaching is about standardizing the result. You should create a new script for the improved process. This change must be communicated to everyone that is affected by it. This won\u2019t happen automatically. The change should also be applied in a slightly different context to see if it holds up well there too.\r\n\r\nThis all sounds very simple, and it actually is. The process of improvement is very straightforward. Most people don\u2019t do it because thinking through each of these steps can be difficult. Having a structure makes it easier to progress through each of the steps and achieve the results that you need. Try this on one nasty problem and see if you agree.\r\n\r\nImprovement is about change and looking critically at what works and what doesn't. It may require breaking new ground and trying something that no one has ever tried. But it may also be adopting a best practice that you have seen applied in a different context. Driving improvement takes a certain mindset. It requires that we ask, \u201cHow can this be better?\u201d, \u201cWhat would I really like from this process?\u201d. It requires an attitude of optimism and the ability to see the potential beyond the current reality.\r\n\r\nAn innovative mindset will help you to overcome the inevitable resistance that you will encounter as you begin to change things. Think about what must change in your environment. What things could use improvement? What would bring you the greatest benefit? What would be best case scenario look like? What obstacles must be overcome to get to that new potential? These are the questions that a true innovator asks.\r\n\r\nThe clarity of the answers will allow you to share your vision of the new future with those around you. Great changes always involve others. By having a firm understanding of where you need to go, you can build a team of people to help you get there.\r\n\r\nBegin looking at your life through the eyes of possibility. What would the ideal look like? You may not be that far off. Use the 80/20 rule, which says that 20% of the effort may get you 80% of the desired benefit. In other words, focus on a few high-impact areas for improvement, rather than trying to change everything. Pick the single largest improvement and create a different there.",
